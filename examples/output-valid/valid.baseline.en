you know , one of the great <unk> have one , and a matter of <unk> at the <unk> research is , by with the people to live , the , in the the ancient those remind you can . of their past in been engaged in the wind <unk> , you on from that it in <unk> <unk> <unk> , you the creative minds who leaves of plants <unk> .
just stopped that i know , <unk> . been <unk> the <unk> , one species or the meaning of the myths of the <unk> the inuit people in does meaning , are , or that in which the <unk> . been the <unk> the <unk> <unk> , this means , , the <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> to design is , this is the thought , the world , in the we live , not in a <unk> sense out there , but is just as a model of reality , as a consequence of really of each particular set of the beyond the meaning our <unk> , <unk> <unk> , of much generations <unk> .
and of course <unk> we all <unk> <unk> .
we are all born . we all bring our children into the world .
we move through initiation rites .
we 've got to us sympathetic with the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> and so it should we will not <unk> , we all <unk> , the dance , and <unk> <unk> .
but every interesting is the unique <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> the <unk> in each culture .
most of <unk> it does n't <unk> , whether it , rate of the <unk> the forests of <unk> on , or the voodoo acolytes in haiti , or the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> the andes , or a <unk> into his holiness in the <unk> . this is in the <unk> , with the i kind of a month in the <unk> traveled in it . or <unk> a <unk> , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> the world .
all these people teach us , it some other <unk> , other <unk> , other ways to <unk> the earth , there .
and this is a <unk> , the , if you yesterday about <unk> , a pencil just with hope <unk> can change .
one of make the myriad cultures of the world of <unk> of <unk> and <unk> life , that the earth <unk> and for that i know as the earth , is as important , like the biological web of , that you than a biosphere <unk> .

the ethnosphere is the great <unk> the <unk> .
you is the symbol of all that , what we are and <unk> we , as <unk> species <unk> .
and they come up like the biosphere been <unk> was , happened , this custom with the ethnosphere -- just with some <unk> has no .


this each of you in this room were born was , on the earth 6,000 languages spoken .
now is a language and not just the <unk> the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is a flash of the human .
you is a <unk> , with the the soul of a particular culture <unk> to the <unk> world <unk> .
every language is like a <unk> forest , the progress of , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> <unk> are .
and of , those 6,000 languages begin to reflect today , as we sit here in <unk> <unk> , that 's the half , in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
they 're <unk> , <unk> . this means , if nothing <unk> to babies , they actually 've <unk> .
what could <unk> be , as from <unk> <unk> to be , of the last <unk> <unk> to be , of your people to speak your language , `` no way to start to have , the wisdom of the <unk> <unk> , or the children to be harmed ?
and yet <unk> this <unk> <unk> actually somebody somewhere on the earth , about . all these two weeks , because of all these two weeks , <unk> a <unk> <unk> and i fell into the last <unk> of the old man is to , the <unk> .
and i know , some of you say , `` it is n't do better and this ? '' i would n't the world view not a <unk> place , if we all just a language speak would say ? '' and i say , '' good , let 's this is <unk> be . let 's you <unk> be .
let 's , it kogi of being wealthy . ''
and then she would you 're suddenly gets to be , how it , if they establish their own language , to speak you could .
like to i show you , sort of a with me from the ethnosphere , going to , a <unk> with me from the ethnosphere , to try to , you <unk> to make 24,000-letter pieces , what in fact is being lost <unk> .
now there 's some that dwelled at all us , the sort were , i , if i say `` different set of the <unk> , '' which really of different set of the <unk> my previous 75 .
<unk> you start to example , this kid the <unk> in <unk> the <unk> , the people of the <unk> , i think , you <unk> the <unk> from <unk> <unk> in <unk> of sacred <unk> <unk> .

they have a curious language and a <unk> the <unk> <unk> is called : you have to somebody married , the a lot of your language , '' .
all this <unk> in the <unk> past , the curious thing , , the great <unk> , in him where because of the <unk> <unk> or seven languages spoken that , is , you never somebody hear , the a language <unk> .
they simply listen you only , and you start then to speak .


they <unk> <unk> photos , , from the air <unk> , what we than <unk> <unk> <unk> would say , from <unk> you , these people from the <unk> in your life . never something <unk> seen the rainforest had .

but the waorani <unk> not just spear with the death .
they speared each other .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> through <unk> .
we <unk> the <unk> <unk> back eight generations , found two <unk> one of natural <unk> and as we the people to <unk> something about <unk> , when they have to , of the people so old <unk> was , he 's because of his <unk> died , and we <unk> him anyway with the death .
but <unk> they had a <unk> <unk> the <unk> , the as it was spilled .
their <unk> could , <unk> one <unk> of his 40 <unk> species <unk> and <unk> , to <unk> <unk> of <unk> .

to print this <unk> a sense to give this course , i understand something about , <unk> think the <unk> know , and voodoo <unk> have to the cult of the <unk> <unk> .
in a way , it on , rate of a contrary .
it 's interesting .
if i show you ask , would , the great religions , what would you say ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or to be improved also always behave rationally .
a continent left it 's always <unk> , because the assumption that was , it in <unk> does n't <unk> think <unk> . of course , there 's a and voodoo is just stopped that <unk> of these very <unk> <unk> out , the as the <unk> diaspora of the <unk> <unk> .
but what the voodoo so interesting makes ayahuasca , is that <unk> relationship between the living and the <unk> .
the living give birth to the spirits .
the spirits can rest of a graduate student at the great water <unk> that , i respond on the <unk> the <unk> , rate of the soul of the living <unk> to <unk> , so the <unk> for grabs a short period <unk> one home anymore to the god , it .
<unk> say the <unk> after , `` to <unk> about the <unk> and <unk> about god .
we dance in the temple and that go to chant god . ''
and because you <unk> <unk> , <unk> you of the spirit taken . like , how can <unk> <unk> be harmed ?
you see these <unk> <unk> : voodoo acolytes in a <unk> , the <unk> coal with <unk> <unk> , a astonishing <unk> the ability of the progress of the body as this way to <unk> , of that it <unk> , when he 's in a <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , it .

<unk> the ancient <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and in one of the <unk> into her , that people in a <unk> <unk> <unk> back , this over the <unk> <unk> <unk> .

<unk> to <unk> day , they of a <unk> priesthood <unk> . the <unk> the priesthood is very <unk> .
the young <unk> be the age of three and four years of she <unk> <unk> and in a <unk> world of the <unk> , in <unk> <unk> <unk> of glaciers for 18 years <unk> . two <unk> of <unk> nine years , two nine-year periods deliberately chosen , rate of the nine <unk> the <unk> <unk> , the you in <unk> their <unk> mother <unk> , to spend you 're now <unk> in <unk> the great mother .


it is so <unk> . to <unk> it <unk> . ''
they call themselves , the <unk> <unk> and say , we , the we the <unk> <unk> are , for the destruction of the world is responsible .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .

well , indigenous people are <unk> <unk> , too . they of the <unk> <unk> .

now , what does that ?
it means , of his kid from the andes , this in the think <unk> , the <unk> a <unk> is , the crime of monotony or to <unk> <unk> , who 's a be <unk> <unk> that , and a lot of the relationship to this <unk> or that place , have , what this enormous marketing of his kid from <unk> , this in the think <unk> , a <unk> a pile <unk> is , the <unk> can be .
whether it 's enormous marketing of the abode one of monotony or a pile <unk> is , is <unk> .
the interesting is the metaphor , that defines the relationship between the individual and the an <unk> .

that made me to other kind of the earth than my friends at the <unk> , the think , that those forests of the abode of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> spirits that are , the <unk> <unk> the world <unk> , spirits , the they were a their <unk> <unk> would you .

it 's a <unk> , that i was a last april in <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
this is , which , of the sort of you have heard , the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> the shaman was spilled .
what which , <unk> makes ayahuasca , is not just by the <unk> <unk> this <unk> , but that <unk> . it 's really of two different <unk> made , the a daemon who sort , there 's this <unk> beta-carbolines , the a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , easy -- who , <unk> . these <unk> alone <unk> 's about this choice than if , a <unk> <unk> <unk> on them <unk> <unk> , it 's but it with the leaves of one <unk> of the family the <unk> with the called <unk> <unk> mixed .
this plant had in some very <unk> tryptamines as the the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> very <unk> .
to make you that when the yanomami seen , have , how they took this <unk> up , these <unk> , the they get out of different kinds of that make from a <unk> <unk> .
this <unk> to get up 's about this is how much of a <unk> <unk> to be , <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> on a sea of electricity .
it 's no <unk> of reality ; it creates , but the <unk> of reality .
i actually with my professor , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the this , of the <unk> <unk> with the discovery around the <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> years <unk> has , about <unk> . i <unk> , that you do these tryptamines , as -- <unk> could , because it in the one home in the statistics you the <unk> <unk> , you , there is , rate of a <unk> to you 're .
but the thing to <unk> the , they wo n't be taken orally can , because you from a in the human <unk> course <unk> <unk> to name <unk> , <unk> be .
they can only offer in <unk> with some other chemical be taken orally , the <unk> <unk> .
now , <unk> is , the <unk> , the in the beta-carbolines <unk> are , <unk> of that 's the kind of these are , the sort necessary is , rate of the tryptamines , <unk> . you ask , so <unk> .
how can inject these people from a <unk> of <unk> of <unk> plants these two <unk> not <unk> plants find , the , if you on this way <unk> , kind of <unk> <unk> do , so that whole being greater than the parts <unk> become is ?
we use , which is <unk> , and errors , what , as <unk> <unk> .
but ask them to the indians say , you know , `` of this plant '' to us . ''
well , what does that ?
this <unk> , the <unk> , have 17 , which , the you all in one species in the forest to be , the training for our <unk> as a kind as .
and then you ask , you , how they establish their <unk> <unk> and they say , `` i can you <unk> something kind of plants .
i my expectations , do n't you all comfortable with nothing is ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
well , it <unk> , out , you every column is the 17 varieties in <unk> <unk> and they <unk> to live in a different <unk> .
now , the <unk> you does n't <unk> in harvard , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> to <unk> .
now , the <unk> the problem is , <unk> who at all us , the <unk> for the <unk> is of the ways -- i have , you what this <unk> and <unk> <unk> , you know , but somehow reduced to die on the mythological past <unk> , as the <unk> world , <unk> our world , <unk> .
well , the fact is , you , so , that i assign 20 feet . century , in the 300 years , for his <unk> or <unk> <unk> be , it , but <unk> than a good a <unk> , in the we <unk> were incredibly uncomfortable , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the earth either <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> . so the problem is not the sea change .
all cultures could have , been with the dance with new constantly been .
and the problem is not the technology that a good , .
the <unk> <unk> not doing less on <unk> to be , as you <unk> and <unk> <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be , as you <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
not change . and this technology <unk> the <unk> the ethnosphere . it 's it makes points . the crude face of the <unk> .

or if we live in the <unk> of tibet go , where i <unk> much <unk> , 's going to the crude face of the <unk> <unk> see it .
you know , the <unk> , the <unk> of people 's <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> , the destruction of the <unk> the people , who 's not only not <unk> , but <unk> and <unk> as part of <unk> <unk> .
and they can take the pain not understand , if you it 's not on the ground level .

the to this young <unk> was this <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> , he just as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we might be <unk> <unk> with their <unk> in the diaspora that , the people , <unk> <unk> .
his mother was <unk> , as <unk> for -- to the <unk> <unk> to be .
he was in the age of two years in the <unk> <unk> , rate of , at the <unk> to <unk> , because you will be without him , life could .
the <unk> , of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , was in a <unk> which .
one day <unk> you from <unk> on a <unk> <unk> and for these <unk> this , for seven years , in a <unk> <unk> .
the pain of tibet can <unk> be , but the <unk> spirit of the people is something <unk> .
and <unk> it off , we really of a choice . you want we live in a <unk> world of the <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity life ?

and it 's <unk> it to think , that our <unk> maybe been <unk> years there .
the <unk> <unk> , of us the <unk> <unk> , and for us in this one from the cult the <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the shaman was due to the <unk> the priesthood <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and at <unk> -- is one of by the only 10,000 years <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> world as we you <unk> know it is the 300 years old .
now , these <unk> history , `` for me , , we all respond to die on the <unk> have , where we look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> off .
if we designed these myriad <unk> , the meaning of the <unk> questions , they respond with 10,000 different <unk> .
and in this <unk> that we the to <unk> , the way to be , what we are : people to <unk> <unk> , the , the <unk> being are , all the six and <unk> of room <unk> to you can <unk> they have . and it , there are great moments of the <unk> .
here 's a <unk> , that i <unk> <unk> end of the <unk> <unk> , as i compared to <unk> on the <unk> went . and of this , <unk> , when she told me a <unk> story of his <unk> .

the <unk> this old <unk> refused to , .
the family , the of be able to have had work , took <unk> all <unk> and all <unk> for .
now have you know , the inuit people of the <unk> . they <unk> you to your <unk> .

the <unk> the <unk> <unk> , not only one of the arctic <unk> or the <unk> <unk> .
he <unk> , out , <unk> his <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> in his hand . and as the <unk> to <unk> started , <unk> he wakes up , in the a <unk> .
he <unk> <unk> on the <unk> the <unk> and as it <unk> <unk> was , <unk> he had a dog with .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a <unk> , took the <unk> the <unk> and <unk> a in , <unk> a other dog , and <unk> over the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so we can you from , nothing is something about .
and this is building on <unk> <unk> a symbol for the <unk> the inuit people and all indigenous people -- the world .
the canadian government there were the inuit people in april <unk> the <unk> <unk> about a control of back , that 's greater is rather than california and <unk> together .
it 's our new homeland . '' which is called nunavut .
it 's a <unk> control room . they <unk> all <unk> .
of an example , like a <unk> , a <unk> , the <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> and they 're trying can change .
and finally , to believe that i , it 's pretty , <unk> for mystical creatures who sort of us , the to , and <unk> the earth traveled are , to get to be , you know anything 're not .
they are homelands of somebody .
they <unk> become part of the human imagination , the in <unk> book ever <unk> . and for all of us , that the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children into this is the <unk> of hope .
what we look at <unk> <unk> finally , to do , is that we think , <unk> never something 're trying it .
we think , <unk> -- we think , <unk> not <unk> is , but we think , <unk> the world can control and so we are we are probably the best <unk> for <unk> in the world . on our <unk> <unk> million <unk> every month .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
our magazines are tens of a million read it .
and we <unk> a series of one by the ethnosphere , on , where we our audience to <unk> of <unk> cultural wonder -- we 're going , you of the <unk> <unk> be . and <unk> , they remain ruled by a , the other kind of <unk> <unk> the <unk> take , that this world , it <unk> has , instead of different <unk> to exist , we have a <unk> in a really <unk> <unk> world of find can , in the the wisdom of all the people to our <unk> <unk> contribute can change .
thank you .
what i 'll give you first , so , as how can , i show 'm , the <unk> work , a new technology , the we look at microsoft as part of <unk> of that 's a year , <unk> . this is seadragon . and it is an environment , in the you can either <unk> or we 're able to <unk> which , <unk> data <unk> this .
we can see in many , many <unk> the digital photos here , the statistics you <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , on <unk> way <unk> <unk> can change .
and it 's <unk> , as many information we look at , how big these <unk> are or how big the images are .
the of much of you are ordinary digital <unk> a <unk> , but this right here 's not happen to an example of <unk> of the <unk> and it 's in a one of the 300 <unk> .
it makes does n't <unk> , because the only , what the <unk> one <unk> like this <unk> can , the number of the <unk> on your screen at in <unk> moment . it has also done a very <unk> <unk> .
this is a whole book , a learning tool for example , in an exponential pace .
this is <unk> <unk> of <unk> . every <unk> is a <unk> .
to <unk> , it , really of a text , and not to a picture on , we knew something like that i do , to really comes to show you , this is a real <unk> the <unk> and not an image is .
maybe this is a <unk> that , a <unk> to read this .
i would n't recommend it .
this is a more realistic case . this is <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
of an image is the beginning a section .
and that there are you really the <unk> and the good experience a real <unk> a <unk> or a <unk> to read , what a good , a kind <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
we have also done something and so , the corner of this particular <unk> the <unk> <unk> 've been .
we have a <unk> <unk> with a very difficult to get <unk> <unk> , the much <unk> , at a <unk> <unk> is , and we have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
if you of this car see want to , you can you see here .
or other models , or a technical specifications .
and this is away with really of these ideas come up on , these <unk> for the about <unk> on the screen <unk> .
we hope , that are n't <unk> and other <unk> means no more -- that i should n't be necessary .
of course , is <unk> a matter of really <unk> one , in a technology like this .
and i want to sit here really wo n't doing a spend any time , this field to say , we 've also suicide seem to this one contribute to be .
but this are all <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> top of the <unk> picture of a nasa .
so , we now , something else 's pull up .
this is now , actually live in the web . you can go check it .
this is a project with the called photosynth , this really marries two different together to .
the a matter is seadragon and the other is a very good research about <unk> , the mountains of noah <unk> , a <unk> the university <unk> , at the <unk> of : steve <unk> , the <unk>
and <unk> <unk> of microsoft research <unk> . a very good , bizarre collaboration .
so this is live in the web . it 's of powered by seadragon .
they can see that , if we that sort of <unk> create , at all we move through images <unk> can , and these experience of the <unk> <unk> make zombies .
but the spatial arrangement of the images here is in the <unk> of the meaning our laps .


it out there is that , the much more spatial .
i would after <unk> a matter of <unk> <unk> of noah 's really show up and this is a early <unk> of photosynth of life that we first contacted peacefully in summer <unk> have , to give you know , to show you , what i believe , it really the <unk> behind this technology , the <unk> . and this is not necessarily so i think , if you the environments that original data-sets -- , the we 're on the on .
we had the lawyers and so , to worry about .
this is <unk> the <unk> notre , the <unk> in the computer , with the images , <unk> <unk> . give you just type notre in <unk> a and they 're images , <unk> in <unk> and on the <unk> so on . from . every of <unk> <unk> <unk> a large image , the earth than to this model <unk> <unk> .
so we are as is all flickr , and all to <unk> on this way in the relationship <unk> .
and we can go on this very <unk> way <unk> .
. you know , i 've never thought , i finally , at microsoft that i 'm .
i am a very <unk> for the <unk> here .

and if you can , i some of weird find out .
of you are tens of occluded so on .
somewhere in here are a series of photographs -- here are you .
this is actually a poster of notre , the right correctly .
we can rest of the poster to a <unk> view of this environment <unk> .
the point here is , we value things with the <unk> environment <unk> this . it are now taking data of all <unk> -- of the that <unk> from this , like , <unk> the earth looks like -- and everything is that together <unk> .
all that digital photos are that together <unk> and it 's make something , that 's greater is rather than the parts the become .

at , this choice than the <unk> the work , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and this is something , that co2 from the <unk> , with the the people 's use that , it and that use it for the <unk> with the <unk> been greater to .
their own photos are taken away with <unk> <unk> , the a lot of person <unk> .
if , do n't the <unk> 've has , and all this sacred <unk> has , and <unk> , who they 're all are , then there 's my <unk> of the notre <unk> suddenly gets enriched with all , an <unk> and i can you what this <unk> use it , to live in , that space , <unk> , in these <unk> , the photos , other <unk> use it and so we kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> experience with the <unk> of other <unk> make zombies .

thank you .
. <unk> i , right ? your software that enables , to a particular at , within the next few years , all those images , the mountains of somebody , in the world are shared by <unk> be working in <unk> together your pictures that ?
yes . they 's nothing is discovering than <unk> .
if you want <unk> you <unk> between the images .
and they does this because of the content inside the images .
and this is really <unk> , if they were a lot of <unk> the <unk> information think , the of the images <unk> .

but that would put it , if that image that you with all by the images your pictures ?
then , is the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> , the , that <unk> , really <unk> . it 's a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , this is really <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
they have , so much .
i 'll give you some of things of my book that anybody about the , like i <unk> , in <unk> with other things are the they 're already heard in . and i 'll try <unk> a few <unk> to you can , make you inject these are n't <unk> .
i want to overlap with the start out , what i `` <unk> official dogma , '' <unk> .
the official dogma of what ?
the official <unk> of all western as the secret societies .
the official way , this : if this : our that will maximize the <unk> our citizens , is , about this one of <unk> from the <unk> the individual freedom the way we are .
the reason <unk> is , that freedom is in , <unk> good , is , <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> <unk> for the human .
if people have freedom , and prostitution on each of us to show up slightly , <unk> of the things to do , the our welfare maximize individual and because has been reduced to us to decide on .
the way to have freedom is to maximize 's more choice to maximize individual .
ever had no more choice people have , <unk> more have freedom they . and i ever had no more freedom they have , <unk> more welfare they have .
this is , i think , so deeply embedded in our <unk> <unk> , it <unk> in the sense to would put it to <unk> .
and it 's also deeply embedded in our lives .
i 'll give you some <unk> of , what we modern <unk> enables .
this is my supermarket . n't have one .
i want to just a little something about salad dressings to .
it out there <unk> <unk> in my supermarket , if you the 10 different <unk> <unk> not <unk> and <unk> <unk> of you could buy to a lot of the number of the sound of <unk> <unk> do , in the <unk> case , do n't the <unk> in the <unk> for its tail , right .
this is so , like the supermarket is .
and then you go to the <unk> store to be a <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . and on offer in a <unk> store yet that there 's so many stereo systems .
we can <unk> million chromosomes a stereo systems out <unk> of the components , the on offer in a store <unk> be .
you to admit , that a lot of choice .
in other <unk> -- the world of <unk> .
it out there was a time , as i was a <unk> was , because she could you get the phone <unk> have , you wanted , <unk> he of <unk> <unk> it .
they have to the phone <unk> . they have it 's not <unk>
a consequence of that was , the phone never broke was spilled .
this reputation for those days are .
we now have an almost done a <unk> from the <unk> , especially in the world of phones .
this are cell phones of the future .
my <unk> is the middle one -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and they should the <unk> now in not in your store seen , have , you can you can rest assured that , they expect it 's relatively soon be .
and what it does is it <unk> people <unk> in the <unk> to <unk> and this question to ask them .
you know , now , what the answer this question is ?
the answer is `` no . ''
it 's not possible a cell phone cameras to buy them , that i 'm not going to that does .
in other <unk> the life , the very much <unk> than that of <unk> are , <unk> the <unk> explosion of choice is to .
health care -- it is n't any longer the case in the united states that you to the doc , go together and the doc says , you what to do .
well , you go to the doctor , and the doc says , you : we could a , do or we could do b make zombies .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what you want to do ?
and they say , `` doc , what should i do ? ''
the doc says , a has these benefits and risks , and b has <unk> benefits and risks .
what you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you i me , doc , what would you do ? ''
the doc says , `` but i 'm not you . ''
the result is -- we call it `` <unk> <unk> . the <unk> like a good thing , but in one of reality , is a <unk> the <unk> the responsibility for the decision , making decisions , is the knows something -- <unk> the doctor -- to somebody the nothing know , and <unk> <unk> is power , like , in the <unk> <unk> is one from to be -- <unk> the <unk> .
it out there 's a <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> for people like , and me , this , if you think about , all what does n't makes no sense , because we they wo n't buy them .
why , they market to us if we ca n't buy can see ?
the answer is you expect of us the doctor <unk> next morning <unk> and it 's a <unk> the <unk> , asking themselves .
something like this as dramatic as our identity is now become a question of choice , like this slide show should .
we do n't inherit an identity has , we get you .
and we get us , as <unk> as we want .
this means , every day , if you <unk> comes the wake from , you one you have , what to the kind of person you want to be .
in with me on <unk> and family , there 's a time , in the the <unk> was , that almost everyone had a had and that you so , as <unk> like you could , and then , so , as our children <unk> like you could .
the only <unk> choice was , `` well , who , '' , not <unk> , and not what you and we did .
nowadays everything is just to have .
i <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i <unk> you 20 percent less work than i used <unk> .
and that i 'm not because they 're less <unk> are , and not because they 're less <unk> .
it 's because you with other things preoccupied , are , you ask , <unk> , `` should i get married or not ? should i now we get married now ?
should i get married later ? should i a have kids first , or a career , and do ? ''
of these are all consuming questions .
and they have that these questions <unk> <unk> this , whether this means not doing all the <unk> to make the i 'll give you <unk> and no good <unk> in my <unk> to going .
and in the <unk> they should that i do . this are <unk> to <unk> questions .
work -- we are <unk> , like <unk> <unk> has , with the <unk> the enables us every minute of <unk> day , <unk> <unk> on the planet , that -- <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
it out there <unk> is one corner , of the i <unk> about , i 'm , a matter of the <unk> worked .
i 'm going to it 's not telling you about , because i put it does n't want to use .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have learned in with me on the work that they have to be , again and again and again , whether we 're working should or not that i should .
we can take our <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we have our <unk> a matter of a <unk> , and our <unk> the other <unk> , and our <unk> <unk> on our <unk> .
and even if you all <unk> are , every minute in the we 're watching our kid have <unk> one <unk> <unk> `` what we also , `` should i , <unk> 're going ?
should i kind of these <unk> respond to do ? should i , <unk> writing ? ''

<unk> where we <unk> , from the things and small things , <unk> things and <unk> , life is a matter of choice .
and the world in the we looked like to this .
so to say , it out there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in the we now live looks like this .
and the question is , the good , or bad news ?
the answer is `` yes .
we all know what the good as it is , so i thought about what that when it 's repertoire .
all this choice people have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a classic network effect , <unk> way , is , he <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
with so much <unk> of that apply to choose that can , <unk> it people 's very is this , all to decide on .
i 'll give you a another <unk> example of , a <unk> about investments in <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> of me , we had <unk> on <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of about a million <unk> and about . <unk> different <unk> .
and what you is that was <unk> 10 mutual funds the the employer offered , took the <unk> of two percent for .
they <unk> 50 funds the -- 10 percent less <unk> <unk> part of biology than if you only offer five <unk> at . why ?
because it with 50 funds are , the modern tools for some off , it is so difficult to decide <unk> to choose should , they expect it on the morning <unk> .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow human course tomorrow never comes .
understand that you , that not just means , the people <unk> <unk> got to when you the <unk> go , because they do n't have enough money to <unk> have , it means also , that make a decision is so hard , you from the <unk> their families at the employer <unk> .
and the not <unk> give you <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> year on one of the <unk> , the <unk> would she up to <unk> .
so paralysis is one consequence of to the choices .

you want the from really magnificent , right decision , if it for all eternity , is , right ?
they do n't want the <unk> <unk> <unk> fund , or <unk> the <unk> salad dressing .
so that is the is one effect . the other is one effect is , <unk> if we the paralysis <unk> and a from decision , <unk> we 're less satisfied with the result of choice , what this , if we the to <unk> could get us between less options to decide on .
and it , there are several reasons for this .

ever had no more options there 's there , <unk> about it 's all comfortable with nothing 's going to regret that is disappointing , in the choice . '' you will be .
second , what economists costs call themselves .
<unk> <unk> has been a large point , and 've by he when that 's very the kind of oxygen in the we value things <unk> , a <unk> to what we put it <unk> .
good , if it 's very many alternatives to <unk> there , is it up slightly , more attractive imagine that amount of alternatives , the you <unk> , that 's you less satisfied with the alternatives , the you 've chosen .
here 's a learning tool for example . for the mountains of you , the n't <unk> <unk> are , <unk> i apologize .
but here 's , what you 're supposed to be .
here 's a few couple on the .
very expensive real estate .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . they have it all to show up slightly , <unk> .
what could be better ? `` well , damn '' of this <unk> , `` it guy is .
everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is the way .
i could <unk> of my be <unk> . ''
and he <unk> two weeks , the left out by the he skinned the to <unk> has , day from over day , a <unk> <unk> to have .
opportunity costs decrease the satisfaction , the we move through our choice made a , even , if you know , what we choose have is terrific .
and i ever had no more options there 's the choice : there , <unk> more attractive features of choice that the opportunity costs reflected by microbes .
here 's a another example .
now , this cartoon makes it some lot of .
he 's a probably about it in the to live , and maybe he 's also think about doing things slowly to do .
but a 're point , the it makes is , been choosing one , for this is one thing to decide which , one , other things , to do .
and these other things <unk> many more attractive features , have , and it 's , what you 're going to you less <unk> make zombies .
third : escalation of expectations .
this one has caused me <unk> , as i my jeans <unk> wanted to .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and it out there was a time in the it just jeans on a kind of having forgotten there , and they have , you <unk> , and they have a bad <unk> , they were <unk> <unk> and if you wore them long enough <unk> and often enough <unk> they fit , have , they started , `` <unk> '' <unk> .
so i went to print this new jeans came to buy them , you years of wearing these old , and i said , `` i know , after a pair of jeans , right here 's my size . ''
and the <unk> said , `` you want <unk> , easy <unk> or <unk> ?
you want <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> or <unk> <unk> ?
you want jeans with them distressed ?
you want to you on a far <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this , '' and so went , when he .
my <unk> was growing up on and <unk> i <unk> said , i , `` <unk> know , after the kind , the used to the only kind of accuracy was spilled . ''
he had no <unk> what that was , so <unk> i have a <unk> with all these <unk> jeans <unk> , and <unk> the store -- and i say the truth ! -- with the <unk> <unk> jeans , the i ever had .
i put it 's better . all this choice made possible for it me , it 's better match to have .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try it for me <unk> to explain this .

i had very low expectations . i had no particular expectations , as it , they only offer in a kind of having forgotten there .
as you in 100 of that came , damn it , a lot of you know , been perfect be flavors ,
and what i <unk> was good , but it was not perfect .
and so <unk> i know what i 'm in the only had to the what i <unk> , and what i was disappointing in compared to the what i <unk> .
the <unk> of tools of the pictures that life , the people <unk> <unk> the expectations about the people have about how good as these options will be .
and this even to you less satisfaction with the produce , even if the results are good .
people in the world of <unk> knows this . because , if you it would say , <unk> they are n't all <unk> it here 's it .
the truth is more like the right here .
the reason is , that used that everything is better was , and all us worse , was , as all us worse , was , was put it for the people used that have experiences to make the a pleasant were .
nowadays , in the world in the we live -- we <unk> , as citizens , with <unk> than <unk> -- the best for that you can ever hope that 's the things quite so we are good as you attach it out of you be .
they 're never <unk> <unk> . because your expectations , my expectations , <unk> .
the <unk> to <unk> -- that is <unk> you all <unk> are cell -- that <unk> to <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a <unk> <unk> moment -- that i met with a <unk> <unk> it , and she 's really very <unk> .
<unk> know , it does n't do better and do this . i 've already saved me , <unk> .
but settling is not always magnificent , a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of the <unk> a bad <unk> jeans when it just a kind to buy there is , if you <unk> are , and , you ask why , who 's responsible , is , the answer is clear that 's repertoire . the world is responsible . what could you can do ?
if <unk> of different kinds of jeans <unk> are , and you buy a lot of this is disappointing , is , and you ask why , who 's responsible ?
it is equally clear , the answer to the question is you .
you could buy it 's better can do .
with a hundred different kinds of jeans came in <unk> , there 's no <unk> to the errors .
and so , if people make a decision , and even if the results decisions are good , and , disappointed about , you though , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> world in the last generation .
i believe a <unk> -- not the only , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of the <unk> , and even <unk> , is , people 're have of this is disappointing , are because your <unk> so these are . and then , when , these experiences <unk> explain this got to , they think they expect it your fault .
and this is that <unk> , it for us <unk> better about , <unk> , and we expect us worse is away and .
so let you me when you will be .
this is the official dogma , this is that we all , right not , and <unk> . it 's not <unk> .
it , there are no question becomes , you know , something completely from a better , is what this is no , but it 's no not , the more choice better , is , something choice .
it out there is some magical amount . i 'm not what it 's repertoire .
i 'm me pretty confident , we , big point to survive long <unk> have of choice that our welfare , where options are .
now , as a <unk> the question is -- i 'm almost this -- as a <unk> question becomes , the thing about the <unk> . that ought to all this choice that enables us in the as the secret societies , is the material <unk> .
it , there are many several in the world , and we have of much of you 've heard , where their problem is not the to of choice .
to keep their problem is , that they have too .
so the things about the i <unk> are a <unk> problem is the modern , is , western societies .
and what is so <unk> and <unk> is : steve <unk> has you <unk> about <unk> like this <unk> and of hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a <unk> of money .
what i 'll give you <unk> is , these <unk> , <unk> decisions -- it 's not just , that they wo n't help .
do you might actually hurt .

if something kind of the what the people of our improved enables so they have to be able to the secret societies in him where the people to do too choice that have all those who would , would n't just by the way to the people options , but of the would n't even options are .
what economists call this is `` pareto-improving move .

so to , this , does circle around , this cartoon , and , a <unk> person , and says , `` <unk> ! what knows this fish know ?
you know it 's nothing is possible in this fishbowl . ''

ever had no more i but it however , <unk> more came after i want to the view , that the fish knows something .
because the truth is , if you know , shatter this fishbowl , so that everything is possible , have , they do n't freedom . they have paralysis .
if you know , shatter this fishbowl , so that everything is possible , you decrease you satisfaction .
you increase the paralysis and you decrease satisfaction .
everyone needs a fishbowl .
this is almost with <unk> certainly going to <unk> -- perhaps even for the fish , <unk> for us .
but the <unk> be a <unk> fishbowl is a <unk> for <unk> , and , i suspect , <unk> .
thank you very much .
you know , i 'm talking about some of these projects 've before talking , and disappeared over the human genome and what the <unk> could , and disappeared over the discovery of new <unk> of genes .
actually starting we have a new point : we have of biology digitizing and now to do we go from the digital code , in a new phase of biology uses to get it by we create new life , with designing and synthesizing .
we have been trying to so , `` what to ask them .
what is life ? it is something , what i believe , many <unk> have been trying to understand and the of different <unk> .
we have a different <unk> trying to it <unk> on the <unk> components to <unk> .
we have it 20 years of digitizing it . than we know , <unk> sequenced have <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
now to do we started to ask , whether we live <unk> this or if we create new life can take this , of this digital <unk> ?
this is the map of one of all an organism , <unk> <unk> , of the <unk> genome of species <unk> the , <unk> in the laboratory <unk> can change . and we have been trying to see if we know , with a . <unk> genome 're trying this .
we have it <unk> of about <unk> genes , <unk> of the 500 or so , the are here .
but if we designed these <unk> map <unk> , the very simple ; it is , in compared to our laps . <unk> you 've told me , this is simple ; it . but if we all these genes <unk> the we one , the other <unk> this is it 's very <unk> that this to a living cell <unk> at .
<unk> have we <unk> , it the only way , <unk> is this chromosome actually to synthesize what we <unk> the we are the components to actually vary and so we are some of <unk> questions to ask them .
and this road we , with the question becomes , we can pour a chromosome we synthesize ?
enables it the <unk> these really large <unk> to you can go to some never before 've been ?
and , if we that can , we the chromosome we boot ?
a chromosome is so <unk> just a piece <unk> <unk> material .
our <unk> at the <unk> the life that were <unk> .
our ability of genetic code to has , very slowly an but one <unk> . and our <unk> point would now on a <unk> <unk> on .
we have of <unk> years with <unk> .

like , <unk> is <unk> very <unk> .
it out there <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world of small pieces of dna that make you can , 30 <unk> 50 letters are but it 's a <unk> process , so let 's ever had no longer you might pour a piece , makes ayahuasca , <unk> more errors <unk> .
so had we have a new method for making with the we designed these tools for a little pieces <unk> and the errors <unk> could .
that was our and this , starting with the digital information , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it 's a <unk> 's over the bacteria <unk> .
we <unk> small pieces , a <unk> and had a dna molecule of about <unk> letters .
the <unk> phase came than we cross this piece <unk> <unk> <unk> and in a <unk> when , and the <unk> started the genetic code to read , and made <unk> particles .

so , i was met with the <unk> talking and they <unk> that they took this model that 's <unk> .
they laughed more than to it here does .
so we think , that a situation -- is in the software that in the own <unk> build can live in a biological <unk> .
but we wanted to some that went , go . we wanted to a <unk> <unk> chromosome build them . it has no more than 580,000 letters in the genetic code . so we thought we , we build it in <unk> of the size of the 's <unk> we the size of the <unk> could actually vary to understand what the we are the components of the living cell are .
design is the <unk> , and if you with digital information information in the computer , we boot up to this digital information of really <unk> be .
than we cross this genome first <unk> sequenced have that was the <unk> at a more errors <unk> 10,000 <unk> .

a part of the <unk> is it , the pieces to you 've the 50 letters long that are and the with other <unk> pieces <unk> have , rate of <unk> <unk> to build so these <unk> .
we have unique elements here design .
they have maybe nobody will ever heard that we put watermarks in .
think they have about , and we have a <unk> code , `` a , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of letters -- these letters <unk> about 20 <unk> one , and so here there 's a single <unk> for every of <unk> .
so we can the genetic code use that 's our world make words , to keep writing , sentences , thoughts .
<unk> have , all we <unk> .
there people were disappointed that 's no idea was not poetry .
we have the pieces so <unk> that we you just with enzymes <unk> could . it out there are enzymes of these <unk> and again <unk> .
and we have started making pieces to you can , starting with pieces of <unk> <unk> <unk> letters <unk> , <unk> these <unk> to <unk> to make a , that height again <unk> , <unk> to <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> have we designed these pieces in at <unk> so we you <unk> could , because we grew up a very <unk> process to create you in a minute that can be .
we have been trying to the point of automation to get .
so , this looks of like a basketball playoff .
if we started to , right large pieces 're limited -- with about <unk> <unk> -- and then begin to this did not just type in e. grow . it <unk> all of the modern molecular biology . and so <unk> we decided the other <unk> to .
we knew a <unk> the <unk> <unk> is called , the of biology put a dna to <unk> , the poem coming at the pieces <unk> can change .
here 's a learning tool for example that . it out there is a pencil just an organism called <unk> <unk> the last three million <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
you see in <unk> <unk> , its chromosome just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> 24 hours later , has , and all to <unk> how it was spilled .
we have thousands of organisms that can do .
these organisms can <unk> <unk> that , you can actually found naturally in <unk> life .
i 'm in assured that we live in <unk> exist , and , can move , the <unk> , <unk> a new possibilities .
in fact , the nasa has that it shown a out there .
here 's a <unk> of the molecule that we made , have , by we designed these processes <unk> have that -- in fact , have , all we <unk> ; yeast mechanisms with the right design the pieces we have we you <unk> . <unk> <unk> these expensive and then <unk> together .
this is n't <unk> it 's a <unk> <unk> .
it 's this is a <unk> molecule , that we put it 's a with the <unk> can see it .
that these are pictures over a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
this is the publication the we have a short while , this just one .
that are pictures over 580,000 letters , <unk> code . it 's the largest molecule with <unk> <unk> that i ever made of create .
it has of molecular weight of over 300 million times .
if we put it with a <unk> of a 10 extra-virgin olive oils and with <unk> <unk> would we would put it <unk> <unk> <unk> , just to , the genetic code <unk> .
now , how we boot we have a chromosome ? how we activate we cross this differently ?
i think is , it with a 's very simple ; it 's repertoire . it 's much <unk> with bacteria <unk> .
it 's also about the if you think it in , eukaryotes like when we put it are cell does : you go into just stopped that <unk> <unk> and there is a other <unk> , and this is that 's uncanny , what you all over the <unk> have heard about .
in <unk> is the chromosome , in the cell <unk> but a short while , have we showed , you a <unk> <unk> one <unk> of a cell to other do i can control and that we activate can change .
we <unk> the chromosome a <unk> . <unk> <unk> , these two for <unk> 're talking about how people and <unk> . we when it some <unk> <unk> so we cross this chromosome so these could . we <unk> it with enzymes to all the proteins , <unk> . and it was a very as distant as we put it in a cell -- when -- and they have that our very <unk> <unk> here <unk> --
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought , we sit here -- that it is , but we have been trying to the process is something went to bring out .
this is a mechanism of evolution right here .
we find all kinds of species in here of a <unk> chromosome that have taken or a <unk> of <unk> , of a thousands <unk> in just a <unk> to a species <unk> .
people , the , evolution think this enormous marketing of one gene changing , to that at changed , it have missed much of the biology <unk> .
it out there are enzymes the <unk> called that the actually digest dna <unk> .
this chromosome that in the cell was who has does to the <unk> the we put have that .
it was in the cell <unk> and <unk> the other chromosome as <unk> material <unk> it and so we had we <unk> end up just a cell with a new chromosome .

and , a very short period of time have had it all <unk> of species were lost and <unk> , and in a new species based on the new software of we live in the cell <unk> .
all the proteins <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , -- as we the genetic code <unk> , was , it 's the what we <unk> .

now i 've argued , is not the <unk> is -- that <unk> on <unk> billion years evolution .

why do this do ?
i think it 's pretty obvious in the needs a glimpse of what we need that .
we are gone from of <unk> to nine billion people the next 40 years <unk> .
to it in my context to ask , i was in a year born in 1946 .
, there are now three people on the planet for every one of the last year 1946 ; there has one ; within of his 40 years that it four be .
we have a half to <unk> , with <unk> and <unk> water , <unk> , fuel for <unk> billion people .
it 's a going to the credit for nine stretch to .
we need that over five billion tons of the coal , <unk> billion <unk> oil . that are <unk> million <unk> <unk> day .
if we use over the biological processes to think of monotony or <unk> process to the way to <unk> , it 's a <unk> challenge .
then course , there 's the whole co2 of this material that in the atmosphere ends up .

the <unk> had a <unk> components , and you know , the diversity , the richness that <unk> .

we have , marries because of <unk> <unk> , rate of the way to do what we <unk> <unk> call themselves .
we have of the to a large robot to build the million barrels of <unk> <unk> day , can make zombies .

and it 's just <unk> <unk> . we can , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of chemical or <unk> <unk> and so went .
this is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the we 're working on , with the statistics you , actually <unk> and new species <unk> computer <unk> <unk>
you know , we do n't know necessarily how it 's what 's gone . we know <unk> like , where their <unk> code , what 's gone .
we 're focusing on now fuels that the fourth-generation fuels .
they have , <unk> to <unk> seen , what it just a <unk> experiment .
we have fuels that the <unk> and <unk> are going to the <unk> soon <unk> be the much <unk> <unk> have to look , like octane or out of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only kind that biology into a large impact without have this road of the <unk> on <unk> or the <unk> of their <unk> have , it is , if we co2 as <unk> see , and <unk> that we ended up the cells the , way to go .
and we think that we the first started to 'll the fourth-generation fuels be , and that in <unk> 18 months .
sunlight and co2 is one method
-- but in our discovery around the world , have we all kinds of have methods .
this is a an organism , we described in .
he and in the <unk> , about <unk> about lives , at it <unk> <unk> .
it <unk> co2 , in methane is a graduate student at the <unk> of <unk> than <unk> .


you know , we have a really -- <unk> <unk> like the <unk> the that <unk> <unk> . 's uncanny , if you know , not at ted , do i can , where <unk> ? a <unk> the <unk> to be .
but come up working we <unk> it , the same <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
they have it this year with the <unk> seen , we are all been a year <unk> <unk> and have a year to do too , if it 's the right <unk> is rising .
i think , that can be changed by you <unk> vaccines in <unk> <unk> .
this is it , like the future perhaps what could be able to <unk> , can , the <unk> <unk> be able to <unk> bacteria , <unk> , and <unk> eukaryotes .
we are <unk> this is from the people to <unk> . : our goal is it just , we have a <unk> have long enough to <unk> to know , perhaps to do . thank you !
the last year at ted <unk> there i have a <unk> to the lhc .
and i promised back to get to , to give you to explain this is like the machine worked .

his were is it , the a second to create , that you less than a <unk> <unk> , beginning the universe <unk> -- and the <unk> to <unk> million chromosomes a really within a <unk> .
it 's just only not ambitious .
this is the machine <unk> of <unk> .
we <unk> images of <unk> in <unk> on .
so , this <unk> i . he <unk> , by atlas detector -- <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in is .
here of <unk> picture is the atlas in the <unk> so you the <unk> see it .
<unk> on . september <unk> <unk> <unk> the machine to for the first , .
and this picture was of taken by atlas .
it <unk> in the <unk> .

in other words , colder than we cross this picture <unk> on . september <unk> , we knew that we , the machine worked , what a <unk> .
i <unk> not , whether this , <unk> the <unk> , or this , colder than to do n't the <unk> sort <unk> and the <unk> so <unk> .
it means , we put a cultural impact it , the as well .
about a <unk> later there 's a problem with the machine , with , <unk> here 's going to do we had -- these <unk> wire here .
these gold wires <unk> amps when the machine <unk> is working .
now , the engineers at the you begin to you look at and say , `` no , do you do n't . that are small wires . ''
they can do that <unk> , because if you very far <unk> , they have to <unk> <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> than the space between the <unk> , you can inject these gold wires . <unk> <unk> .
in a matter of <unk> , between over <unk> magnets in lhc , there 's a <unk> .
so <unk> , the wire <unk> and its 13,000 amps <unk> suddenly <unk> <unk> .
this was the result .
now , that everything is some <unk> when , might think , the magnets weigh over 20 tons <unk> and , rate of about , 30 <unk> those .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and had to you take , what we 've also did .
we <unk> you <unk> , <unk> you .
they are now , all along with me on their way back .
<unk> end <unk> of the lhc again <unk> be .
we have that it <unk> , and they expect <unk> data in <unk> or <unk> <unk> to you can , and on with our <unk> , rate of <unk> what the <unk> the universe are .

i think the fact , it is so hard , the fact , we 're talking about : our 're <unk> 's running , <unk> the value of things like the lhc .

thank you .
i am a writer .
books has lead to keep writing is my profession , but it 's of course , more than that .
it 's also my from , <unk> love and <unk> .
and i want to change not , that , that i ever going to do it .
but is <unk> something <unk> in my life and my career <unk> , the me <unk> which has , my whole relationship with respect to this work , and to <unk> .

the result is , i , <unk> <unk> i <unk> , <unk> 'm going to what this would i the doomed .
seriously , doomed !
to an example to you will be <unk> on me , and say , `` <unk> you not , you , never going <unk> be harmed ?
they have , they do n't be afraid anybody , you to your whole life <unk> and tomorrow never again create a book , the <unk> in the world are going ? never again ? ''
you know , that 's really reassuring .

the people <unk> : <unk> n't you afraid , you 're never going to have ?
are n't you afraid , you from the <unk> a <unk> <unk> ?
are n't you afraid , you are on <unk> your life are <unk> and that will ever something else 's ever attempted contact and that you on a <unk> <unk> dreams <unk> <unk> , your <unk> <unk> with the creative minds who to the <unk> ? ''
so about , you know that .
the answer -- the <unk> answer to die on all these questions is , <unk>
yes , i 'm afraid of all , things .
and the i always been .
and i 'm of orienting yourself in a lot more things afraid , the people many at .
like <unk> , and other <unk> things .
but , if it <unk> writing is think i 've been <unk> about , and the question me , why ?
, is it rational ?
it is <unk> , of somebody should be , he was afraid anybody who has , the work to start to the he wakes up slightly , <unk> <unk> ?
and what 's is to the creative <unk> is , they expect us <unk> over the <unk> <unk> do , in a kind , how it other <unk> n't do ?
my to , to an example , it was a chemical and i can me , do n't situation -- in <unk> 40 years , chemical be , in the he <unk> was , whether it afraid you know , chemical to be .
with -- <unk> , <unk> , how 's <unk> how that ?
it just did not , you know .
but to <unk> to be , the really of chemical have about the centuries not just stopped that reputation , <unk> <unk> people from .
we <unk> <unk> but that sort of a reputation , in . but not just the <unk> , but the creative people across all <unk> , <unk> , a reputation to have , <unk> <unk> <unk> to be .
and all , what do you have , is , , the ones who <unk> of really is <unk> alone is from the 20 feet . century <unk> , the young and often of <unk> hand <unk> .
and <unk> who , the not actually <unk> <unk> , <unk> , she <unk> really <unk> to be .
<unk> <unk> said , a generation ago , its <unk> in its name the last <unk> : <unk> my books has caused me a little went <unk>
a extraordinary probably , the you about statement to do this .
but we <unk> not only when , if we could lead to make something to hear , because we have this kind of a lot been to <unk> time <unk> . that have we of these are so <unk> and <unk> <unk> , that creativity and <unk> that course <unk> and that <unk> , <unk> end , always ultimately lead to <unk> even other .
the question becomes , the i , <unk> ask everybody here to choose is , is this idea , you <unk> in <unk> ?
and , so i know ? -- because with all just a <unk> <unk> -- i <unk> me to of these are not at all know .
i think it 's odious .
and i think they dangerous , and i do n't want <unk> , like , the next century <unk> , it .
i think it 's better , if we 'll appreciate our great creative encourage to live .
and i 'm <unk> , it for me , in my situation -- very dangerous would , to start , , <unk> <unk> the assumption be <unk> , especially in the sort of , in the i in my career , down <unk> .
this means , you know , i 'm pretty young , i 'm only about . 40 years old .
i maybe nobody in a 40 decades of oxygen in me .

i say , it <unk> , because we are here yes , now , all that friends , it 's <unk> probably , my <unk> going to look behind me , is .
<unk> , <unk> , what to a thought !
that are the kind of us out , of somebody <unk> bring you can , rate of at nine <unk> to start , <unk> to <unk> . and the way to do n't .
i would prefer this work that you do , the i love .
so the question becomes , right ?
, <unk> time on the <unk> seems to me , i , rate of that writing , can , kind of <unk> <unk> psychological <unk> have .
that have i think of now , a way to find , have to writing is <unk> distance to <unk> between me , and my very natural anxiety about , like the reaction to die on the <unk> of being taught to .

this <unk> led me the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
does so you 've told me , because the <unk> to babies , again <unk> .
but the ancient <unk> and <unk> have the people ca n't believe , that creativity of the human , you know ?
they believed , that creativity in a kind <unk> <unk> was , the seriousness of a time and unknowable , <unk> source , the people from human , from <unk> , <unk> some choice .
the <unk> called these divine <unk> of creativity <unk> .
of <unk> is <unk> , he starts to him , he know , a <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of went <unk> <unk> .
the romans had the <unk> idea , famously called that sort of <unk> <unk> spirit a <unk> .
you know , which is . the romans did not actually really magnificent , a genius a particularly clever individual was spilled .
they believed , a genius assigned to this kind <unk> with <unk> was , of the thought was , it <unk> the <unk> one <unk> and , about this is like <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the artist as in the work , sort <unk> <unk> and the result of the work that biology with at .
this is brilliant -- there it is , because the distance that , of the i was brilliant -- that <unk> psychological construct , the you , of the so -- the work <unk> .
and everyone knew , it , functioned , right ?
the artist as the <unk> was kind of <unk> things <unk> , like , to an example , to much <unk> , right ?
if your work was brilliant <unk> you not everything <unk> to you <unk> . everyone knew , you this <unk> genius <unk> , you know , how <unk> .
if your work <unk> -- not <unk> your errors , or do ?
everyone knew , your genius was a little something kind of lame .
so we have the people in <unk> really long time about creativity <unk> .
and then , from the <unk> and everything changed , . we had this from the idea , and these from the idea was this : <unk> us the individual human being the <unk> the universe began to ask , about them all <unk> and no . and it , there are n't more room for <unk> <unk> , the <unk> from the divine 're doing .
it 's the beginning the rational humanism , and the people started to believe , that creativity and from of the individual it .
to for the first time in one of history hear anyone to people , or referring to ancient artist 's a genius call themselves , having this , he 's a genius .
i want to tell you , i think , that was a errors .
you know ? i think , a <unk> person to <unk> , he <unk> , he or you will be like that <unk> , like that <unk> and the <unk> and the source of all divine , creative , <unk> , <unk> <unk> is a <unk> little bit about to much responsibility , to you a <unk> , human <unk> <unk> .
it 's like lead to asking , the sun begins to swallow .
the <unk> and <unk> whole <unk> and it creates all this <unk> expectations , going .
i think , of that <unk> our artists for the last 500 years <unk> .
and , if you know , true , , and i think , it is true , the question becomes ,
we can do this ?
maybe another team to <unk> <unk> over the relationship between the six and the <unk> the creative <unk> .
maybe not .
maybe we know , <unk> of the 500 years rational not just type in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and there 's probably people in this audience , the really <unk> scientific <unk> <unk> would over the <unk> of , basically , <unk> , the people <unk> and <unk> on their projects and so on . <unk> .
i 'm probably , all of you on this with me , going to take this .
but the question becomes , the i want to pose is , why not ?
why not quite so we think about how ?

a process , the , , like , who knows , the it 's ever tried has , to make something -- so in other words , <unk> everyone here -- not always rational <unk> .
in the <unk> can he wakes up slightly , <unk> sometimes .
i recently wrote a poem coming at <unk> than i the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the ability now about <unk> is , the but to your whole life are <unk> was spilled . you , when he told me , you than you in <unk> virginia <unk> out on the <unk> working . they said , they would and she listen you can like a <unk> over the landscape , instead of you <unk> .
they said it was like a thunderous train of air .
the over the landscape , on , they come barreling down at .
they felt , if it , because it at the earth that dwelled at she <unk> to <unk> bring out .
you knew , you in a at just one of do that could . and that was , in now , which , <unk> like the <unk> .
they <unk> like the hell to be as you of this <unk> by this thing . it went <unk> <unk> , you , as enough to <unk> would and a paper get into this , so you it , if it thundered through time they <unk> <unk> , <unk> and on the <unk> <unk> could .
in other <unk> was you not , as enough times . they <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but they <unk> the be , and the <unk> <unk> from you <unk> and she put it . they said it would be went over the landscape , <unk> and , like , said , <unk> to other <unk> <unk> .
and then there 's all these were moments , the interesting part i never were , you said , it forgot -- there was in him where they expect it would almost she .
so you <unk> to be and <unk> , the would and the <unk> <unk> from you <unk> and you with a paper like , chewed it thundered through time they <unk> and then , said , you know , was put it , as she would start with their other hand and 's running and it to <unk> going .
they <unk> the <unk> , its <unk> and i fell into when it back and in one by the body and <unk> it on the <unk> would catch it .
at , <unk> , from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the would catch the , but backwards , from the last <unk> to the first .

this is not at all of like my creative process -- i 'm not the pipeline !
i 'm a <unk> . of participation went up working to you can have i work every day , the same time <unk> and <unk> , me <unk> and i really <unk> <unk> .

and i imagine , of you know , also done .
<unk> i had work that are or ideas , the seriousness of a source through me <unk> , the i really wo n't <unk> can change .
what is the credit for a bad thing ?
and how <unk> we 're under construction so in the relationship with about it our <unk> to lose , but us in a actually at <unk> <unk> to you will not ?
for me , is the best who example , like to this do that can fade the <unk> tom <unk> . i <unk> him of some years , in a <unk> <unk> .
we , of about this <unk> . and you know what ? of much of time when defending his life he was tom , the <unk> the <unk> modern <unk> , the talking , these <unk> creative <unk> , the in <unk> <unk> , to <unk> and with you <unk> .
but then he was he older , and <unk> . it when she told me , he just one day on a <unk> in this is <unk> and all . and because the pronunciation changed , and all to him .
he and all to get has than he suddenly of his <unk> a <unk> hear , the , how it at into as is , for him <unk> this : <unk> . and he want to you . you is <unk> . he <unk> and , but he can you do n't <unk> .
he has not such a piece , would , he has n't make the paper , he has does n't <unk> .
he <unk> , these <unk> anxiety around the <unk> going , like . <unk> 'm going to that thing to lose and i 'm of this song on <unk> be haunted by microbes .
i 'm not good enough , i <unk> it <unk>
but <unk> in <unk> to <unk> , <unk> he wakes up on .

he <unk> up the <unk> and she said , <unk> , <unk> you not see , i <unk> <unk> ? ''
<unk> i so apparent from this , i went down a song <unk> ?
if you really exist want , <unk> to <unk> moment , again , if i to you <unk> can change .
if not , go bother somebody else today other .
go quickly , and you go bother leonard
to this process has , and changed .
not the work <unk> . the was that as this <unk> like <unk> and i ever written .

it could create a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> collaboration give people , a kind <unk> between tom and the <unk> , <unk> thing , this is n't be remembered tom , was spilled .

this idea <unk> me , i fell into the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> was spilled . i <unk> in a lot of <unk> the <unk> in the we all <unk> , if we ended up the working on something and it does n't <unk> . you <unk> , to think , it 's a <unk> , it . that 's the worst book , that i ever <unk> .
not just bad , but the worst book ever .
i started to think , i should this project just dump this .
but then reminded i it , like , tom , the <unk> <unk> talking had and i 'm talking it .
i <unk> so my <unk> from <unk> and from my <unk> in one of <unk> corner the <unk> .
i was brilliant machinery : <unk> to , you thing , you and i know <unk> , if this book , <unk> is , it 's not , and my fault , is , right ?
because you <unk> yes , i have all , what i , <unk> . i 'm not the more than that .
if you it 's so do better have want , <unk> you can see here <unk> and do your <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
o.k . but , if you know , not <unk> -- do n't you what , then to the hell with .
i 'm going to him anyway went to writing , because that 's my job .
and i want to does not going to <unk> give people , i , for my part of the <unk> here <unk>

this <unk> were always which , because the dancer himself , they were <unk> and they were terrific .
but <unk> and again , very <unk> , happened , something <unk> . of the <unk> was actually <unk> .
and i know , you know , what i my expectations , because i know , you all in your life that when a at some point seen this .
it was , at the time <unk> and the dancer himself , from a kind <unk> <unk> . he <unk> nothing different than he 's ever before has done -- <unk> <unk> before . but everything <unk> , together .
and be suddenly <unk> , he would no longer <unk> <unk> .
he was done of <unk> <unk> and of on <unk> and everything <unk> , from a cell with <unk> .
than this is something and for happened , we knew the people 's what that was spilled . they called it at its name .
they <unk> of them together and they started to <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , <unk>
that 's god , you know .
interesting <unk> <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you , <unk> with . the <unk> changed , in <unk> the centuries of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to `` ole , ole , <unk> , that you have been engaged in at <unk> and <unk> hear .
when a <unk> in <unk> something <unk> , something <unk> has done , <unk> , ole , ole , <unk> , which , <unk> <unk> , there it is : a <unk> <unk> of god .
and you know , which is , because we need that .
but , the <unk> part of some <unk> next morning , if the dancer <unk> <unk> and <unk> , it <unk> at a good a <unk> is , and he would n't any longer a <unk> of god , in , <unk> .
he 's just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> . and maybe it reshuffles , he 's never again going to , <unk> going .
and maybe he 's never again else <unk> called is , when he wakes up slightly , <unk> . but what should he then you with the <unk> his life and ?
this is hard .
this is the most painful a creative life .
but maybe have it does n't be quite so does <unk> be , if you of <unk> , not to have , the most <unk> your <unk> of you <unk> .
if you have maybe he just think , they distinguish a <unk> are , of a <unk> source for a <unk> time on your life , the , do other <unk> to babies , if you this that are .
if we and , so we think about , it starts to replace that everything .
so i 've started to think and so i think , with our national security the 've months , as i the book working in , that will soon as it reshuffles , as the <unk> , <unk> , been <unk> <unk> freakish <unk> .
what i me <unk> <unk> to have , if i 'm talking about <unk> 'm , is , <unk> n't be afraid .
do n't be daunted .
just do your job .
be that up for your of it , what it also been he starts to this piece .
if your job this is to dance , do .
if , the <unk> <unk> genius , you know , how to sort just one is , <unk> , for grabs a short period of one a <unk> of <unk> through your <unk> to show you , then `` ole ! ''
and if not , do your dance anyhow .
and `` ole ! '' to you , nonetheless .
i guess at it and i 'm -- that must , we should the peoples teach it .

thank you .
thank you .
ole !
last year i showed these two <unk> showed , to <unk> , the arctic ice , the training for <unk> three million years of <unk> the <unk> <unk> states that we had , a 40 percent <unk> .
but this <unk> n't have been enough to the <unk> this particular <unk> from , because it 's not the <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> the arctic ice , <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
they expect it in winter and it expands in summer .
the next slide , the i 'll give you <unk> , is a <unk> what the last 25 years <unk> .
the permanent ice is to marked in .
like you see , it 's all on the <unk> <unk> . this is that <unk> <unk> in winter , one , and it expands in summer .

in 25 years it 's of reception here , right here this might be .
this is a problem , because the warming , <unk> reason that 's the arctic <unk> <unk> , in the it <unk> which were a <unk> <unk> there , <unk> , when he <unk> , of <unk> to methane <unk> , it .
<unk> with the that <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the atmosphere , you could , of <unk> <unk> , if we , <unk> point <unk> .
like that you today is actively bubbling up in some <unk> lakes in <unk> methane of <unk> of the water .
professor <unk> <unk> the university of the <unk> is with a <unk> <unk> to other <unk> <unk> last winter traveled in .
whoa !
to about it 's good , the question is , how it 's make us okay .
and a reason is , of <unk> <unk> <unk> greenland from the <unk> .
this is a melting .
but the <unk> are <unk> <unk> than ever .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know , like the <unk> through <unk> <unk> here <unk> , the sea .
this <unk> <unk> <unk> to .

last month <unk> <unk> , the entire continent is now in negative <unk> .
and the <unk> , the about a few <unk> <unk> is , is particularly been working in <unk> .
this is that 's over 20 equal , so like greenland .
in which , the himalayas largest , the top you see new lakes , the front of a few years were glaciers .
40 percent of all indigenous people on the world in the half of your <unk> of this <unk> .
the andes , is of glaciers . <unk> for these <unk> .
the <unk> have , <unk> .
but if you <unk> , who 's also done that i 'm pretty much <unk> <unk> .
in california there was a 40 <unk> <unk> the <unk> the sierra seen anything .
this is hitting the .
and the <unk> , like you 've read , have , <unk> .

and the <unk> <unk> the world have learned in a really <unk> and <unk> never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> so many in the last 30 years as the <unk> <unk> .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern .
if you this in <unk> context of looking at , you can you see , what it <unk> .
the last five years have we <unk> million tons , that co2 <unk> all 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day , in the <unk> .
look , the one , the <unk> <unk> 's a good , from <unk> continent <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> , where it 's a <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> there .

oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
the united states that are a matter of two <unk> <unk> , together to <unk> .
and the <unk> was , many biologists have <unk> to build them .
but we start out , a sea change to see it .

<unk> there 's a <unk> <unk> in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> last calendar year <unk> <unk> , rate of clean coal plants talk to <unk> , what a good , like a <unk> in , is .
that image reminded me , something .
's ads around christmas <unk> <unk> , in me to <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> tons <unk> .
they have it 's probably saw the news seen anything .
this is in our over the largest waste stream in .
this happened around christmas .
of the <unk> the <unk> 's ads around christmas was this .
frosty the is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
it , there 's in <unk> and <unk> in america , and he <unk> our economy , grow .

he 's <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
this is the source of coal in west virginia .
the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
so you 've already saved me a be clear say , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , they do n't know , what you <unk> .
so has the <unk> for <unk> two <unk> the whole life <unk> .
this is , a part of them .
in the <unk> can we view climate change as a <unk> <unk> for our store .
like time have we put it for us to <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> to be a <unk> on the way to bring out , rate of the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is n't dirty .
we think , you is <unk> -- and <unk> also some good
well , do , n't worry about to the climate change .
leave you that up for us .
clean coal , they have heard a .
so let they expect us sympathetic with a <unk> of modern , clean coal <unk> make zombies .
they were terrific ! , that machine is pretty machinery .
but it 's the sound of coal technology .
and one by the burning of massey coal of the <unk> for the global warming , is , the <unk> clean coal technology , the you see here , it starts to change everything .
look , it , that 's a good , this is the take , clean coal technology .
finally , the <unk> alternative meshes with our <unk> challenge and our going to the <unk> security challenge .
america is in a <unk> , the economy , the <unk> security , the <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> , the answer these all to , is that our <unk> of <unk> <unk> like <unk> coal and <unk> oil .
but now there 's a <unk> , new solution that , rate of us out of <unk> is to <unk> .
repower america with 100 percent clean electricity <unk> , within the 10 years
a <unk> , america back to work to bring out , we <unk> to make and to help stop , the global warming heats up to <unk> .
finally , a solution that , the 's big enough , our quest to solve our laps .
repower america <unk> . find they get out more .
this is the last .
it 's about a repowering of america .
of the <unk> ways , our <unk> of the old , <unk> <unk> , the meaning our world <unk> , to <unk> .
the future 's over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
new investments , a good high-paying to do .
repower america <unk> . it 's time , of reality to get real .
it out there 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> , `` if you want to , go <unk> .
if you go far want to , go together . ''
we have a far to , and we need , as .
thank you .
i want to so we start out you , asking , so , the time of their <unk> <unk> , as you with <unk> <unk> .

the spatial think this is <unk> so <unk> , as we put a <unk> our environment understand .
this <unk> -- <unk> of the kind of our so to <unk> <unk> -- together to my <unk> <unk> and my was <unk> <unk> , i started to wonder -- and what would , if we computer use would say , of having a <unk> , the , like a digital <unk> on a <unk> <unk> around -- what would , if we 're able to the two <unk> <unk> you could , an <unk> <unk> and this is a you could , as we put it want slim fit ?
this question was so <unk> , that we decided to explore the answer <unk> and siftables <unk> .
a <unk> , a siftable is a <unk> computer , in the size of one <unk> .
they can seek restitution with the hand be moved around , you can , each <unk> , you can sense their motion <unk> and they have a screen and a <unk> .
that they 're physical , are cell are <unk> , <unk> , you look like blocks , just from the <unk> of them and <unk> can move .
and the siftables are a learning tool for example of the new generation of tools for manipulating digital information that data .
and if this <unk> <unk> are six and a <unk> , in their motion and for , , each to and the <unk> of the <unk> with you <unk> , then when we can seek restitution with the explore some new and <unk> <unk> start out .
i <unk> with some simple <unk> , .
this siftable is for the <unk> configured and if i put it in a one way , of the video <unk> <unk> one ; when i him into the other is one way , is it backwards .
and these interactive portraits <unk> , each <unk> .
if i show you so the other <unk> , <unk> the next to <unk> .
if you <unk> <unk> are , <unk> you know , even and you can make something <unk> be .
and you and also sense their motion and tilt .
a interesting consequence of the <unk> , the we 're going to get to started , was , we <unk> <unk> on data <unk> you could , like <unk> color this way to <unk> , like to this custom with <unk> does .
in this case , have that we 've got three siftables act as <unk> configured and i can you can use them , rate of <unk> the in the middle one to <unk> , where they then you get mixed be .
if we put it <unk> , we can pour a little <unk> .
it out there <unk> also some <unk> of letters in the <unk> like , of course , <unk> or <unk> , where we the things about the to the <unk> <unk> give people and the results <unk> see want .
here 'm i do that this is a <unk> , the i 'm talking with a simple <unk> <unk> .
this is a <unk> with <unk> , this is one kind <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
basically <unk> you every <unk> of every siftable , in <unk> letters and as you 're trying to , make words , to make up , that these about a <unk> <unk> .
then , , about 30 <unk> , it reshuffles , again <unk> and you has been a new <unk> and new set of try .
thank you .

they have a really loved it .
a more interesting of in this kind of one is , you attach the things , many <unk> give people have .
and all what you say , have is `` <unk> words , '' and you know that 's uncanny , what to do .
are here in a few people , the trying it .
that 's our <unk> <unk> there on <unk> .
it <unk> , out , he skinned the siftables up just <unk> wanted to .
so to him , they were just blocks .
this is an interactive cartoon application .
we wanted to a <unk> for <unk> for putting them .
this is felix .
he can new characters into the scene thought , by he just stopped that character shown on from <unk> <unk> , the table that <unk> .
here <unk> he skinned the sun <unk> .
the sun is on .
now he 's brought a tractor into the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! this amazing !
by he skinned the siftables <unk> and other <unk> can he skinned the characters <unk> so that
-- his own inventing .
hello !
it 's a marvelous story it with open-ended end , and he can only one , like , an exponential curve .
fly away .

each of has four different variations one you can these , that apply to use them to .
and you can inject these sounds into the sequence into , the statistics you <unk> in <unk> <unk> a can change .
and you <unk> you a , by you just a <unk> , a sequence <unk> .
there are effects , the statistics you can control live , like . reverb and filter .
you to him , with a particular <unk> and <unk> it , then to <unk> .
and then were some <unk> effects like tempo and <unk> , the statistics you on the entire sequence <unk> .
so long look : we have a .
we start out , in the we the lead , in him into two sequence , and this in a series of a , you <unk> and a little more the <unk> <unk> .
now <unk> i was a bass <unk> .
now i in a little something and drums <unk> do .
and now attach i the filter to the drums , so i the effect live on the drums , can .
i can fade the whole sequence speed up , by i the tempo and the a magazine or other is one way .
and now attach i the filter . with the bass and one , something that more expression .
i can fade the sequence you can rearrange .
so i have i show you not in <unk> <unk> , but i can <unk> one ; they <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
and so to can do i the whole sequence <unk> , by i the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
thank you .
like you so can see , is my <unk> <unk> , new <unk> , for , the better match to the <unk> , as our <unk> and the body that .
and , i had time , you a part of the new <unk> and it some of tools of that came to show you , <unk> we live in our laboratory working .
the thought , that i 'll give you with on the way to give people to choose , is that we , the <unk> to this new generation of <unk> for so , with digital <unk> off , the semantic information in our world of thought , the our <unk> that .
so much .
i <unk> me on the <unk> with you all !
