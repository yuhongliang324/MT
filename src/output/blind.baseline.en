yes , good and gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen .
and you for the invitation here today to talk .
and i said yes , ourselves .
my name is christian <unk> and i 'm wearing strange term , <unk> in the food .
are called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : one personnel in the second , the third the public .
so i 'm for the <unk> city responsible .
and yeah , you how popular .
i know .
, and that 's what my son , and i 'm also <unk> .
that means i 'm the head of <unk> fire .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and so i think about it 's a topic , i am today <unk> want .
it with the theme of <unk> they 're also heard of fire .
we hope to the best , and we of life , and jack <unk> once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then i mean , not <unk> to say .
i <unk> you a position .

many people are <unk> .
it <unk> , and it <unk> .
and somewhere the edge of a suitcase bomb <unk> the left , something <unk> , maybe <unk> with <unk> .
nobody seems wrong are .
the suitcase in . .
suddenly , <unk> .
leave you <unk> .
police comes to fire , <unk> .
we call .
<unk> <unk> .
go out .
what 's because he does n't ask <unk> .
that we know , or we ca n't say .
the people on building .
and cry .
and fall , maybe it makes everything to go .
suddenly , <unk> .
there 's <unk> in .
and panic bursts .
i hear now here on .
i <unk> in your imagination .
but it 's no imagination . <unk> . <unk> ?
this is in this week is <unk> .
there 's such suitcase , the .
afterwards people , which <unk> nine <unk> drugs that .
but the people were exactly , has a friend , i told us from the building <unk> .
it was n't know .
and it came up this <unk> suddenly , in the group of losing my friend of my friend who was .
it was listening is n't panic <unk> something else would all that <unk> not so <unk> <unk> how it does .
you can in a <unk> . <unk> catastrophe happened in a very important .
communication is so important because the people in this situation <unk> of communication <unk> .
they want to what 's because .
earlier in the good at the time , for the authorities was still quite simple .
so we have nothing said , we have <unk> .
why ?
because the called <unk> there .
it has been <unk> to say , god , the people have to panic , because we say rather than the truth or we say , <unk> .
that 's in social media lab in reading twitter users in one of facebook , in the private and public <unk> , in the <unk> and <unk> television is possible .
, and <unk> , because it one of moral authority and second most of <unk> the last year <unk> of the event going .
you remember that , which <unk> the hudson river , is a few year before .
the first <unk> papers on twitter .
someone working on a <unk> that , and <unk> immediately <unk> , here 's a plane <unk> and we save the people now .
that was no <unk> .
and you 're going <unk> , today , and <unk> of <unk> the truth , and very <unk> to <unk> .
because most of course , the last year . you know , because we as <unk> of course , and attention that we just <unk> information <unk> .
there are public media and private , or not so , or they do it .
and we 're bringing food , and that 's also something that in the media that are we think , in the <unk> with .
and in the good old <unk> again <unk> .
however , as a form of <unk> .
that means we will in the next 10 years ago <unk> in the <unk> that 's some of you know that are <unk> if it just to <unk> coming .
i was it .
you know what do you about three , once , a long and once it means .
i do n't make more .
we have today <unk> with all <unk> of this is so <unk> , facebook , twitter the radio <unk> also at the tv and of the local media , and immediately , the course , <unk> , and ultimately provide information on .
and we 've been very quickly and <unk> the and we 're very quickly and <unk> <unk> , <unk> and citizens who else <unk> .
and ultimately achieve more generally believe what we want .
communication in the crisis , which is the idea of a question of <unk> about all of us to stand up , and it 's also a question <unk> .
<unk> is our <unk> problem , <unk> and citizens , or `` oh , <unk> once again , you ca n't , or you say , the <unk> most of it 's all much worse than it in fact is .
we have so good news is done with facebook , one more recently .
also have you maybe some of the way you the media <unk> .
we have a larger <unk> to eat <unk> this .
and it 's called chemical bomb .
and bombs up with a <unk> <unk> are they should n't even though time <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , but through the houses in war <unk> and just on the because of the reaction , which is going to have a little <unk> the <unk> <unk> two <unk> of each <unk> that 's <unk> , and then came out of explosion .
the problem is just as many of bombs never works and a few years ago , <unk> the other marketing foods <unk> .
and there were no one of mr. gore will be certain characteristics very beautiful , and <unk> said , <unk> do we now , he had seen as you <unk> <unk> like , and now <unk> 's the authorities , <unk> that there is a bomb . <unk> in
and since the people older gentlemen reported in the <unk> .
we need to throw everything .
and bombs -- immediately to do n't <unk> things , but <unk> .
and then <unk> park , and <unk> others are the <unk> , a bomb <unk> .
and <unk> history of the communications , facebook , walk around with the consequence of the <unk> far more <unk> <unk> <unk> followed .
and the media . <unk> in .
we had n't even have <unk> , and we <unk> and <unk> , all about <unk> and twitter .
all that had a great effect for us , <unk> will <unk> increases in these social media .
and so if you 've also , give you stop it .
i 'm talking about four o'clock at .
so that <unk> so , because of these social media over the advantage ; they 're very , <unk> .
not so <unk> they were members of the <unk> or <unk> how they called , a high <unk> .
secondly , fast <unk> .
if anything else is , it 's immediately , so <unk> , i 've got to up , because of the whole <unk> in principle , <unk> involved .
and it 's a very high <unk> so , so if something wrong , and then it can also very quickly <unk> .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> the exciting found something like a bomb , <unk> park , about .
and therefore we have from all of the last couple of that are much more <unk> happens when <unk> a public thinks that <unk> you know .
and the city , and every day , such a catastrophe home for .
a bomb , <unk> to be in a park it 's certainly do n't like .
but you can also , and then <unk> on the <unk> found , and then i ended up with our <unk> and try to seven meters deep <unk> .
and i think <unk> i think other cities , then <unk> to be they 're just a so-called <unk> has to conventional notion <unk> can we know already have a variety of houses , was look like before .
and to communicate is important , because it just in a world <unk> <unk> speed this thing about communication to do n't just to panic , to prevent significant for about to go , the people <unk> and for about to do n't want to do you 're looking at the tough situation <unk> .
and the social media and also , <unk> , because ultimately you all of communication involved , and it not just a <unk> <unk> which is how do n't have <unk> , <unk> and also in the <unk> one of .
and so today <unk> not just a task over the authorities did not just a job needs fire or the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> the red cross <unk> <unk> of communication in the catastrophe and <unk> a catastrophe about us .
and <unk> that , shown .
there 's a twitter reports on facebook age of help <unk> they 're also partially and yet , <unk> was , because suddenly <unk> of people , <unk> build , and you did n't know where the <unk> are .
we , there 's still do for the public communication in <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> the <unk> has been shown that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication in the way to think are .
and i hope that i more convinced me that this medium is , yes , for the beautiful things of life often used in <unk> his sense of purpose <unk> and that we as a lot of the <unk> <unk> thing about this instrument of , which is a different <unk> of their dedicated to the citizens to use the <unk> and an the end now , <unk> me , welcome to your attention , so if the whole time barely seen .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
not a writer and <unk> see , just heard this .
and i 'm now , and a <unk> the reasons .
what it 's been there <unk> make it 's what i 'm going to .
before i do n't have a bunch <unk> .
the first one , i do n't have stories of the need .
that we have stories of life .
also believe that it very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories might be as the entertainment actually produced .
then i think about the internet , the <unk> <unk> pancreatic cancers actually , and <unk> <unk> right at <unk> .
and fourth , i <unk> that people who have created the creative .
and happier , as creative be allowed .
more people happy inside , the world .
it logically .
these better world 's now , just a <unk> .
, i 'm going to say , the inner storyteller .
and the story to tell you to starts to <unk> in a <unk> to live in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that 's <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> on .
now you 're going <unk> to sing that is a moment in . it <unk> of what happens , with her .
it happens , in your head in your body , with their perception .
and they did n't really , it .
they do n't there . just happened .
i 've however , it .
i call the <unk> of <unk> .
you see on the <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and everything is quite <unk> .
i 've just like i 'm kind of <unk> .
<unk> .
and other side of the two , <unk> <unk> with a very much color .
and it was this first , i 'd better <unk> and write a new record .
so , that the first <unk> now , with perception and you is a <unk> man with <unk> <unk> hair , the years ago , you very serious look , you congratulations on your life is over .
that 's <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> about what we need to a very particular kind of people .
and so <unk> born .

of you know <unk> ?
very beautiful .
imagine the <unk> at <unk> not <unk> , if <unk> make a <unk> your pocket .
so , dice me <unk> , <unk> , all .
what really important thing about the players have no insight into their <unk> .
so yes , when we die .
i wish i need a long , but what 's just not .
it can also , all heard over .
and <unk> it 's associated with <unk> that .
they 're going to see how they 're actually play .
so again , lost minute by the last have .
a kind of his entire <unk> <unk> has <unk> at the <unk> like a <unk> the <unk> .
now you can , and if that because it 's why games and then why ?
and the very clear : that .
without play the players , around <unk> , gray and only when players play , he is actually alive .
they were to be born .
this .
this story of <unk> and now , the players <unk> the first of turns out of course <unk> in <unk> love , that 's the story , i want .
and form of <unk> .
the first <unk> has 12 , sorry , it 's a <unk> happens in the late 've done .
so , 12 people in the first <unk> the length of one five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , as a person 's a beautiful <unk> tells you know .
that television has been a <unk> nothing else .
that 's not new .
and if it 's been talked about that i first .
and also at here .
now . but properly .
we do n't <unk> back .
what 's the most sentence of the movie or a series ?
it can only be right .
thanks .
as if we <unk> .
and that 's my players , not to .
we can take a lot .
are so many different games .
you only <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
and the <unk> part of the number <unk> .
and <unk> are a lot stories that tells you want .
now , the next question : who do , because everything ?
i 've just a quite high opinion of me .
i think , <unk> , and extremely creative .
but i know , brains more things than just one think of mine .
so it came to the idea of <unk> with the creative process <unk> .
what would have <unk> not just <unk> to allow for even <unk> ?
so if you 'll invite you , and welcome into development of <unk> attached to .
imagine , for example , three in a <unk> , and the class , because he said , for their grandfather of .
and you a fan of <unk> .
then you can now , with the technology is that i ca n't really hard , a <unk> .
and this store them on the <unk> , where it comes directly , and that 's really cool <unk> , really <unk> audience <unk> .
that means it 's not anywhere , but it goes right there where land it .
really nice gentleman in the internet .
and the internet , yes , everything .
so , every medium is that allows us .
that means that , you can write to draw this is , they make choice .
and if we 're now again this .
looks <unk> bit of <unk> the right ?
so this <unk> , what they built .
and i 'm really <unk> convinced that the internet was born in the same kind of stories .
do it , unfortunately , many <unk> n't know none .
so , now , `` well , but even more credible and the audience the male players .
because in a <unk> .
there on the characters from the series <unk> , against people in real environment , well , <unk> on their mobile .
<unk> <unk> , you know that we all very very well , are the mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this wonderful areas like a very <unk> .
and i 'm going to say , because i else again , we need .
we in this together .
everybody is , which is three parts .
the first part of this <unk> of the second part is the <unk> and then , we <unk> .
with that <unk> i could <unk> the <unk> of the moment i looked at the : the <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
this is the price the best <unk> .
and i need to say : this <unk> was a <unk> the banks , <unk> , <unk> so forth .
so <unk> , you do .
and if i want to be here with my dad , right . <unk> structures <unk> , the world , then , i 'm really hard to .
this .
everybody is , which , why is all that because now ?
because it alone in the names all areas <unk> .
we have the first time <unk> : who is `` i 'm `` you 're `` everybody 's time we .
and then they die .
in the series of course , died .
everybody is , which means : everyone needs to die .
and then of : everyone 's time we sense of everyone can up is that .
that 's a totally important .
i come to emerge <unk> 's nothing worse , as if it 's a <unk> .
i do n't whether you know .
if you know theater , and then the actor , in the <unk> and all this : oh , please do me .
and that 's just not .
so it 's volunteers interaction .
and nobody has to
he can also the audience .
the reason why i <unk> 'm so this is at all that project that <unk> be first .
that has also a few reasons .
i 'm with this project <unk> while <unk> and i was and asked , do all that 's english major demographic bigger , blah .
i 'm just say : the german <unk> is the <unk> world .
the <unk> is the english , then the <unk> and then the german .
it 's so , not so , when someone in any dot <unk> move .
also believe that 's really want to other people talking about how they were grateful to be something that by any <unk> <unk> was going to end up every <unk> and each <unk> <unk> has been .
if you 're running , is it would have , it 's the first , now the first <unk> <unk> online .
and if you ask , because now , a <unk> , but under the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
so , and i was done .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also quite on the <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also , and <unk> .
and i can really just say this whole were incredibly important is an incredibly <unk> .
but it uses it 's nothing that there 's not <unk> .
and my project 's just <unk> thing where i just after all taken out what i 've done .
and it , .
and what it 's good .
i can really just say .
so they 're now , thinking : i necessarily inspired my part of course , i had about the idea <unk> character , i got to <unk> drawing <unk> cartoon , we 're also that .
you find out of the internet .
on facebook .
and distributed free . <unk> .
yes , <unk> `` i also .

question . ''

so , because of all remind you 're in it 's happened ?
you may still <unk> forget ?
who has who can be able to remind ?
it into your hands .

apparently .
you .
no , so we want to us to do .
then there are probably quite a .
the evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
and about tonight is , <unk> because of my passions into my two great passions , connects us .
i got to be here in the <unk> , and i like me just with the bits and <unk> busy world today , through the world fly .
and <unk> certain time i 'm now , <unk> its consultants , private firms <unk> field <unk> .
on the 've been so , with the computer 's busy and i 'm now , in the in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so how because that is that ?
how because that change ?
the process , and .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion , artificial intelligence <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was : when we can , when we can a computer building , the world cup of the brain ?
so i think that <unk> that there are we already quite close which .
so i think , so , hundred years longer need to do n't .
but let me to do n't want to be <unk> being needs .
so , compared the computer on the front of our brain other side .
so , to take this is yes , so your smartphone or <unk> , <unk> and these cameras and all of the <unk> somewhere on <unk> little chip .
he 's <unk> the central <unk> <unk> .
these parts are <unk> from <unk> transistors .
the way to have seen everybody , and in <unk> will always a triangle in .
that <unk> little bit <unk> , that has three <unk> and <unk> , electricity , or not .
in our computers in our <unk> , we 've got these extra <unk> , five hundred million this little parts .
and get there 's wild the .
we <unk> things we can calculate the we had degrees ' and albert einstein 's hear it , <unk> computers can be a lot of a very quickly , but can just zero and one that .
you can not .
he 's actually quite <unk> .
we want to respond in our brain .
brain has the smallest unit of neuron , the <unk> and we 're looking out there <unk> a hundred billion dollars a hundred billion neurons are in the gray up here in .
the but is our individual neurons are not only three , but we came up to <unk> one neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of course , just because it beautiful , is 10 trillion .
are out of fourteen zeroes <unk> .
so , because i heard of our brain is not a higher than that we 're now , as computers .
we want to <unk> you compare it may or another one of the first <unk> , which had their own <unk> <unk> , ha , <unk> , and with the <unk> the <unk> was the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> sometimes it , but the up here takes about , watts .
and it , and that is the equivalent of the bananas , so i do n't and their computers up there 's beautiful .
if we now <unk> <unk> good part up here , <unk> <unk> with computers with <unk> , why do we do n't , and then things ?
you know , or this <unk> the internet , this : she uses only 10 percent of the button , this <unk> for instance <unk> brain .
and <unk> there <unk> now , in a bit .
ten percent yes , but our brain is yes , but our evolution of mass <unk> , yes <unk> smaller , in the middle 's neither our <unk> , in fact , everything has <unk> educated .
that is n't happen because we do n't use .
why it 's so we 're in part of <unk> me ?
maybe you know that term , <unk> ?
and i compared to change forever , with the <unk> , if you <unk> see the world in this is the top of the top , it comes <unk> shut down a <unk> .
and these 10 percent up , that that 's about our brains <unk> , our <unk> mind is , <unk> , but <unk> percent of it 's a wonderful giants <unk> , <unk> .
we <unk> , and we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> slow but we <unk> <unk> .
and all the time <unk> this memory back to know , or at <unk> memory .
people realized how much more detail you can i ca n't seen . '' in the situation <unk> , and tell you <unk> , i did i said yes , but already have to do you know that ?
's there 's been doing it 's a particular , so-called <unk> , so someone with <unk> somebody 's mostly on a field <unk> , the <unk> the united states such good <unk> memory , it was in a plane , <unk> a plane , in a helicopter , so fast is that he then <unk> to do n't like rome the end up in rome at it , so rome , now <unk> 're not necessarily the smallest , the next few years <unk> a sheet <unk> has started to rome to draw .
and i somehow , this is the river , and there is like that , no , every single house , every single door and window . once seen . <unk> , it back onto paper .
how do now this ?
so why can be wondering why we do n't worry about <unk> is perhaps even close , <unk> more access to his <unk> percent <unk> .
now leverage , we 're also , but why i can do n't been present <unk> night , in all the ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> of me a lot of experiences .
he once , for the <unk> who has a <unk> working at a foster care experience . <unk> that was n't mind , that <unk> <unk> the brain that 's not what 's the way .
we actually came up very well .
now went out there 's about the people <unk> .

and actually work with that <unk> one , <unk> .
second what i would i was , he has a lady in <unk> he has been told my mother 's always <unk> in <unk> <unk> , as they are at least four years .
there was sitting in your lap 's my mother has read .
and then he said , in <unk> , <unk> , years .
and they started <unk> , she was four times that happens is , they could n't even have read today , you .
and then they said he got to tell me , <unk> .
they actually a <unk> of <unk> in <unk> found it 's on this side you stood in the lady <unk> .
if you so this side , and she was <unk> a picture .
after she read .
so yes , we have to access to , but we seem to the normal life we say <unk> kind <unk> to us , not to <unk> .
now <unk> we 're not that event of how <unk> said , he 's a great image from a lot of <unk> , we <unk> yes , our <unk> , so what we can see in the smell , that we 're seeing this , what we taste and that would be fine ♫ hey , if you <unk> a yellow <unk> thinking and how they were properly <unk> <unk> , you have <unk> impression that , and tastes , very <unk> example .

and do you have a very <unk> , <unk> event in the <unk> past , yeah .
this time i 'm coming .
and they 're going to do n't you might <unk> that you to this memory for visual part .
they get a picture , maybe a film ?
some to do n't really only way , because we 're normal , but that you do first time .
and if you see , it be they 're either great shots of their eyes and experience , or how they 're going on a screen .
and it 'll <unk> the other <unk> .
you , they have thought back to be allowed the eyes . <unk> .
who has had a visual information in your hand up ?
yes , there , but <unk> as a few hands up , that 's so , <unk> third , i would say , that 's about what i expect me , but it 's actually , so often do it 's the first moment , <unk> .
well , `` <unk> on .
<unk> what 's a strong memories , if memories <unk> , `` yes , this memory , <unk> <unk> feeling that we <unk> a <unk> event and i have visual effects , or to see , there was so yes , that was beautiful , there were able to catch laughter , and it 's the memory , there 's actually <unk> deal with our memories , beautiful or other feelings .
and now most exciting .
<unk> everything that was , `` well , the brain makes university , no difference between what we actually remember , and what we 're just imagine what we 're <unk> .
and that test they 're looking at home <unk> down , something in the future of that there is a similar information to do something that if you can remember what the past .
and , if you 've set of these stories , it tells the <unk> round of a time .
now , there is that happens when the beautiful , and most of these stories <unk> more beautiful , the most of `` hey , there are still <unk> , there was the evening , <unk> , there was the <unk> , romantic , there was the waterfall is much higher .
if we already in <unk> and so if our memories that 's why do we 've been actively explore my life ?
<unk> and here , and my uncle is shown in his hut , in switzerland .
a very nice image , it 's also a very beautiful hut .
this picture is that <unk> a beautiful , hut , so it 's artistic freedom and he explains , there 's a hut <unk> little <unk> , there is that <unk> more pigs . 's a beautiful , before , there <unk> sun in the alps , that . this is a hut to begin to <unk> .
and why do we 're not with our own thoughts on our memories , hey , what <unk> me , because it 's still a lot of what i think about what ?
they have the artistic and in their own thoughts .
<unk> you know , so some people around the morning , if the <unk> eyes , what 's because what ?
yes , `` bad <unk> , i went around the <unk> through the head .
really the night and this idea -- no .
i think it 's , and he of them .

what the father made , so he has every night with the son <unk> and that , it has asked me what was because that <unk> which is what happened ?
what was because that <unk> to tell , and then he 'll tell me with him <unk> the way to him to tell you 've been great happening .
and , <unk> two weeks went to her son <unk> .
and then , ok , <unk> way , `` yes , visit .
and the world today , that , all the youth being done with this is today , <unk> and i know .
these are not the memories of influence on the way we are , but it 's our focus on , our focus on the thought we use .
and how to focus on <unk> to use .
so if you <unk> <unk> thoughts <unk> or say , today , <unk> , that 's so , <unk> we need to do n't really not going to make it , how do you know tom <unk> in this <unk> fiction . he said , these places <unk> computer , where he <unk> <unk> <unk> , you do , but also the first look at her image of this <unk> sort of this as well not great joke , you say , right , <unk> now <unk> , but i <unk> the way .
what <unk> to do <unk> and yet , ah , and beautiful , <unk> time . <unk> yes , and i <unk> is really like this man , that was that was beautiful , well ?
and then you know , with .
you that is <unk> and let 's <unk> .
or if someone <unk> <unk> , <unk> , it <unk> in your head , or your wife , or her , <unk> posed laughter , <unk> .
so , you again , we put them to <unk> funny hat on `` hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> 's the horses jump , they laugh , why do you ?
because they <unk> , because there was funny .
and so much better with the situation , with .

no , the brain has the capacity to everything <unk> .
it , but nothing , because we can free , how we a lot of the event , a memory , and the way , it comes up .
my <unk> , you know , you play with the in your head to use power of the <unk> and give him every day <unk> , and enrich themselves .
now , good afternoon .
you for an invitation .
so on a party asked to you , and so right here , i do n't tell you do with friends , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , then i see <unk> eyes and in the inside my audience , <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> up .

frank <unk> once said , music to talk is so how about architecture to dance .
and so this is that also , but what we
and yet a given i i 'm going to a short film brought
.
<unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
that 's my view , on the point .

we <unk> are today , between <unk> the middle eastern end , when you very early in our youth the kind of force gets pleasure to classical music <unk> .
so i experienced that the <unk> the <unk> of <unk> us from the joy , `` a little <unk> .
and we are satisfied . belief in fact that crisis by the classic was n't have <unk> , so the music is , and <unk> .
so let 's going to keep a <unk> create the music store near my friends and this force , that there , we have to put them .
so how a <unk> to move beyond the <unk> the <unk> works ?
we 're operating parameters are from the classic <unk> know , the same light in basically the question .
so , for the relationship between <unk> and musicians .
usually put between stage , and <unk> a gap .
we try to <unk> .
you see a picture of our <unk> .
the musician , in a drink beer , the world , and breaks the <unk> to stand up with two <unk> to put them back into the audience .
all that will , the evening , <unk> .

you sit in <unk> .
the classic <unk> , that you , which <unk> it . <unk> very similar as you here , is moving forward , and <unk> .
there 's music , because you know , still sit down .
and we have to do is to be able to .
if you anywhere in order to a <unk> the music <unk> we listen and different ways .
it 's coming out , <unk> not a stage , <unk> four <unk> the audience <unk> .
the audience could say yes <unk> .
so , the evening everybody in the first things .
important for us that we 're just any <unk> do in terms of music from thinking .
and so , we ask the spaces and <unk> <unk> but also in the heads , takes the music that you can do n't know , to do ?
and so , there 's concerts in order to <unk> about 30 years <unk> the s 's just <unk> <unk> to be in clubs . <unk> in the old <unk> .
but not just the spaces <unk> and the lighting it was alive to make <unk> for connection with other <unk> .
and so we are totally happy n't have been working with the <unk> together to work together with us <unk> or movement to make <unk> to , and dance that has been .
and so , then <unk> for <unk> of <unk> or <unk> saved steve rich .
and in this year , we 're saying , if you want to <unk> <unk> .
we have time , a <unk> together with a <unk> of .
we have the story of soldiers , <unk> <unk> to act of <unk> , <unk> and just <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
that has one of it works because it was <unk> of us in this piece supported .
we have a <unk> lot of people interested in germany <unk> , that <unk> .
it 's this <unk> this from a <unk> out of .
we are totally happy in the near <unk> in the <unk> <unk> a home one .
the city is the size of the great , and exciting to free concerts , but also a small that we <unk> .
if a year in <unk> two weeks <unk> <unk> from europe the city and then just like , the city of people <unk> <unk> , usually .
all that <unk> will <unk> organized .
we <unk> are a <unk> of students and students , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really totally completely <unk> .

but also <unk> , but they a year it for example , <unk> or <unk> the <unk> in . hands are going to our <unk> organized .
we do all in our , and live in germany distributed .
that means the part of the <unk> and on a <unk> .

and <unk> , and then , or 30 volunteers <unk> keep praying for a few days or a few weeks their hands bring and there <unk> to help it , in the <unk> to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> .
and in these fourteen , the musician .
now you could have to have you know for a <unk> needs .
but our <unk> 's still on .
so we 're in <unk> the city of <unk> around us , so , supported , and what we want .
that the classic <unk> in fact , but also very practical things like , for the <unk> , because we have a , of the bread <unk> or <unk> of fresh food and turns out .
that <unk> , in a <unk> the city in the whole year , and sells .
to the <unk> .
we 've <unk> a whole <unk> found us to their living to be a musician ; we can .
and it 's that <unk> to something <unk> york city , and , in this town .
they identify birds in particular way with that <unk> .
since the year we 've all <unk> support of an local economic <unk> a call it 's all that <unk> on a <unk> and <unk> <unk> turns out .
we <unk> from <unk> -- classical music <unk> , <unk> , in the right hands .
so we 're happy about what they 're in europe young musicians out in their own hand take home at the people <unk> hold .
if you 're still not so i can imagine how it feels likes to experience , then when they just over .
the next year we are in <unk> and we would be <unk> and then , there are .
yes , and gentlemen , the prisoners learn .
think you <unk> .
we heard him to learn from the effect a technology , but i mean , and i heard of , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> collect and <unk> win .
so the experience , <unk> , a nice formula for the <unk> .
no matter of art and culture 've done well , because i can a lot of to say , because . ar <unk> <unk> i am in this field .
and so , about that it may make this is something <unk> `` the time . <unk> able to give you do my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , makes very much work .
they 've been laughed .
you <unk> always the <unk> though most of <unk> know .
so why ?
i think that has to do that in the word , something <unk> we 're not so that we can .
art , that we say , sometimes that has happened .
to work , we could argue that has happened .
sometimes .
the people like to work that has to me .
but if we think of the <unk> and the art of the rich beyond the <unk> , where we 're in the , collect its own thoughts .
and i <unk> like to you want to talk about three hours in five <unk> shared with all the <unk> , and i starts to talk about simple proposition .

the interaction , and to run a <unk> life and then five years <unk> .

<unk> , two and <unk> .
you learn them in the first two years of the <unk> , and i have the <unk> .
and so long ago , 11 , these little <unk> played the piano , not distant cliff here , and <unk> at home .
this <unk> live in <unk> .
there is a tune your and the other voice <unk> it 's different .
the rhythm is the same , but it 's <unk> .
and that , and gentlemen , the world is something <unk> the art , <unk> , and if it just give you 're <unk> <unk> put together to think that the present , the future , sometimes work , <unk> the images , in <unk> work , <unk> these things <unk> are on a moment <unk> we 're doing art .
and i 've learned two , <unk> in addition , in the <unk> <unk> the time to play , somehow get to hear the <unk> of the other .
this , and i 've got to the other .
another experience , so i never forget and i did n't worry had to me show you can go .
i have the <unk> 's been more people in the room , so here today , the middle <unk> came out .
i had never forget .
i 've <unk> played .
so again forward , and the same as i knew it wo n't .
audience has more <unk> almost as i had walked in all quiet on my place , <unk> , grades and put them and forth and third time of forward .
and they do n't expect me <unk> we put behind .
but that was a very <unk> experience .
maybe that was also a personal experiences , where i knew well , with the i moved quickly , <unk> that i should be my <unk> to go , to be easier <unk> .
yes , the next next chapter one <unk> , yes <unk> the inspiration and i wanted to .
and then , <unk> was , i went to my <unk> came to him a gentleman <unk> i 'd like a <unk> play .
and he said , <unk> , that 's not .
there , many <unk> to have a great experience with this collected .
now imagine time ago , a <unk> young man , and young , is a sentence .
and i can not forget .
and sort of course , <unk> .
now i was actually go through time in a <unk> .
i 've <unk> and i remember , a situation , i 'd never experienced .
it was <unk> of <unk> of chopin , i 'll part of have a i 'm just not <unk> she was the <unk> the a wide you had the poor , and then went to put together , apart .
i can see in not play a piano , and i could it 's more .
and i think , or 30 percent <unk> played and suddenly , and the right .
and then , and played out <unk> , i got interested in a <unk> played , and i just like , i suddenly on the floor <unk> and <unk> .
i was except me .
i had nothing <unk> , nothing , and the music that , with me , done .
experience , where i 've got to emotions , really <unk> .
and sometimes it 's also true , to work done in <unk> <unk> , in this condition , i call it and every single <unk> .
where all kinds of the running .
we had this situation , and then in the <unk> <unk> an organization .

well , my <unk> with the piano , and artistic , `` the artistic work .
and now that to my <unk> , <unk> .
i was first a musician <unk> , but just as <unk> .
we have <unk> played the <unk> , <unk> .
i 've <unk> , and wondered , etc . and my <unk> for the music , and <unk> , and that <unk> this .
in the singing , they breathe , a <unk> singing a wonderful <unk> , very , and <unk> .
and then came a point where i <unk> in the <unk> theater , <unk> i 'm going to <unk> and the <unk> , and i 've been so with <unk> <unk> this chapter , because there was this <unk> came out of this idea came up from that combination of art , i was at the <unk> also beginning of <unk> <unk> , politics and <unk> a profession .
because art of culture to try to my <unk> .
so here , for the art , but just not as artists , otherwise would you 're not <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and something that .
i was there in theater and wondered <unk> i was in germany , no <unk> for <unk> the only in vienna , there are <unk> , and i 've been more with this question -- what you can do all the relationship to the <unk> art to take a good a whole thing , <unk> to ?
and why i also <unk> 'm in the workforce crisis in this <unk> , <unk> years ago , then <unk> .
but i was another <unk> , and this phase , yes <unk> effective interaction .
<unk> , the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> though sometimes in my c.v . in <unk> born in this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> about , <unk> i 'm going to the kind of <unk> .
but i 've set of <unk> root , because my grandparents maternal and also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> about the <unk> .
that was done before , which is not so the middle and suddenly became <unk> another form of culture , in a <unk> our culture has lived out of people in this case , <unk> device during <unk> .
once the <unk> , <unk> they were all walkable . the world . <unk> .
and i do with <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of my friend and so there are then , for the <unk> evening was made me , the only piano , and yet another way to <unk> played for example , and then <unk> <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> done so , but these texts , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and this <unk> , that came away from the people out .
it was my destiny with the day , november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> begin with the wall fell .
i woke the next day , i had <unk> test , oh , the wall is like , yeah .
and yet growing really prepared for any questions . <unk> .
and there was i <unk> for the cities in the <unk> .
and there , so i 'd experienced an interaction with interactions will between two germans cultures .
it 's the same language of the music , there 's wonderful and we played on the things that <unk> , <unk> .

since is germany , <unk> .
since the world . <unk> much more <unk> <unk> .
interaction , then , all things here , and the town food .
we have a <unk> that i had actually a <unk> to imagine that time ago , when i 'm here . <unk> i stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture , .
i 'm still .
, stood for <unk> could n't write <unk> for culture <unk> .
i was in the first , the <unk> .
so i 've found such as well , anyway , wonderful , these <unk> and she disappeared , because i then for education <unk> , and so <unk> the opportunity to forge .

many , we could and i could design and i 've experienced the ability to what that means you look different people from different areas in a goal tracking .
you realize this is more <unk> from the art , the culture , about us to the <unk> people , between cultures and communities , i said , we take , but afterwards , and back .
interaction was also interested in <unk> , as we 're going <unk> seven <unk> the idea of the <unk> january <unk> , that <unk> the world <unk> <unk> <unk> .
but this last chapter , and fifth chapter and yet , <unk> <unk> .
word `` yes different meanings , i 'm going <unk> with something that <unk> so for something and i can see , as verb , and say , i <unk> something that means i know something .
and it always in his <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , so i 'm going <unk> you , or this community .
and i <unk> me with something you look at the <unk> and say , just heard to me , what i identify .
and that 's a big action .
five <unk> three million people trying to move <unk> cities to identify in the sense of <unk> and it was a community is in europe .
as big , we have it <unk> , but anyway , a community of people in a big <unk> life and the least a common language to talk , <unk> nations , and this was our <unk> the <unk> to <unk> in the people and a lot of the <unk> .
the signs , <unk> the very different <unk> .
and experience from the <unk> i did n't so many people <unk> .
there <unk> has <unk> <unk> and food , two schools , with a young girl from <unk> a <unk> , and a student from a <unk> school , <unk> <unk> the letters of young men ski lift <unk> to a <unk> <unk> at home , <unk> , and death grip of letters that have .
and it was already a special effect of this young girl letters of young <unk> <unk> and the russians out letters of young men from germany , <unk> <unk> .
and sat on these young men the piano and played this <unk> , and i loved .
and `` oh , i quoted him from a letter and said , <unk> , he wrote him into a young german , and he , and i can never been <unk> play , because my my two fingers on <unk> are .
and he <unk> his finger , <unk> i sat down into the piano in this <unk> on <unk> carl and tried to <unk> to play .
and it <unk> him .
it was for me , <unk> scene 'm going forward <unk> , `` i said , what we do ?
we have learned to live <unk> that many people together to move , but all things we 've learned that we <unk> years ago , <unk> peace , and the culture so you 're not talking heads <unk> we 're different languages , the way to help us <unk> .
and that was for me a wonderful experience and you can do you 're not just want to know .
it to learn more about something that experience and <unk> to win .
and if we can invent the invention we 're going <unk> , we need to inspire them versus art and from the position to relate to the dialogue with the when we interact and finally in our own identity , to work by us with art and culture <unk> and then we have all the
and i hope they 're still <unk> and <unk> that we need to take the it .
you .
yes , you .
i think , the first picture that .
i 've got to <unk> to support my <unk> here 's a few slides <unk> .
it , the slides , but it in my <unk> here 's about a direction to find tie me with a theme <unk> , where i think that the next significantly and .
through the <unk> words , i finally , you say , which is also means , and i think . <unk> so this talk . <unk> .
and then i had never heard that are in english , and if somehow , but if you look , then you see , you would n't understand what i and i wanted to <unk> n't know how did i say , and so i started to talk , but on <unk> . .
how we die .
i have the first of <unk> .
<unk> the patient in the hospital in . i <unk> <unk> , and it was <unk> .
she was about <unk> years old telephone has always like you may <unk> they 're also reminds us who remembered the first , i like , and then .
and so , every time , may , dance to the long <unk> , and then a <unk> <unk> much <unk> , and then <unk> and it 's side of the middle leg broke the <unk> .
a few years before was also in <unk> and the same way , with <unk> for them in the left leg .

it a sense , a sort of people like <unk> a lot of people ?

and then cured .
five years later that the clinic can see the name <unk> , i can do n't realize he 's just so rare is looking for the time , and it 's dance , we may be one leg .
so , it 's what <unk> i was actually , when i 'm going to of themselves , i said was in his <unk> , or what he also <unk> <unk> ?
and that 's a bit of the <unk> .
you see here of <unk> 's called how we die .
it 's a book from the <unk> , how we can be a report , <unk>
and that it so that the globalization , forward to go , so you ask me how it 's go <unk> to work ?
you 're going to talk about today . <unk> , i was a <unk> to be the same <unk> .
it 's the work <unk> , it will also a lot stronger <unk> an example , china , at a big issue .
and then that come back in the work in the individual , so something <unk> , something <unk> to lower <unk> was that he always , controlled by starting from the quality , <unk> of accuracy .
and that sense of <unk> people , and <unk> sort of you could be more a little <unk> , where we would you the high <unk> to do n't about through his work of them .
and if we can transmit them <unk> and medical area , there 's exactly the development .
and television has to talk , <unk> and also <unk> the most <unk> , it 's the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when there , and he made it 's <unk> is , it even paid , and if you , then one of the service of course , care or this medical treatment you ca n't .
and these <unk> , but the work <unk> the stronger <unk> and more <unk> this idea that his <unk> by using a personal belief <unk> , in the background , i <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a good friend of the problem . <unk> that he 's a more and i had a <unk> in the that it 's a <unk> went from the doctor for <unk> .
the <unk> are going developments , a <unk> forward and he is martin , just experienced far more old people <unk> between <unk> the hospital , and forth , because the <unk> n't know what they should it comes to get worse .
then the hospital , <unk> go back into <unk> , or <unk> , and yet , there on the .
and this <unk> had not just about this is structured ways <unk> there 's what i want to train them to see here , <unk> you 're from this <unk> the <unk> and also <unk> <unk> of people <unk> .
there , well , <unk> of stuff , however , after he described language , <unk> learned from a teenager sitting there is happening , which is <unk> happened was .
it will also to die of a <unk> introduced .
it 's not the <unk> of counting , but you put themselves , and so i want to do , <unk> things , or not , when i <unk> .
and then it <unk> .
in <unk> , the third , finds a conversation with the <unk> instead , and then , <unk> want to hospital or i want to , you look at something happened .
that i want to <unk> , i do n't <unk> .
this data back then a central and there is a doctor for <unk> has always <unk> on in front of the right decision on this basis .
if we now , <unk> <unk> , yes , you may <unk> , and once <unk> was , and if you do n't be a <unk> you do n't want <unk> going to have you to dance in may last may -- then <unk> is , <unk> do n't experience .
and that my friend now , in <unk> is a lot <unk> , how he started with this .
year , is that <unk> today about <unk> to seventy percent of people in the dying , but in hospitals , <unk> , and that these <unk> as well , you can be able to not the ideal habitat for an old people , but it 's often very closely financially , <unk> <unk> there are <unk> are often <unk> and the , steam and this <unk> find out of the perception , just limited instead .
there . <unk> they are not make it 's <unk> people there , but when i <unk> at , and we have been <unk> on the year , so excited about <unk> , <unk> be a <unk> to <unk> that would have to say , it 's . so there , <unk> and <unk> self-esteem <unk> .
so , <unk> reasons that 's the whole <unk> , these people 's so introduced a year , the reason why does n't know , <unk> and in and <unk> the bottom line is a lot of care <unk> or medical <unk> get paid to be able to tell you come to get good , there , for example , <unk> a family to feed with a or two children .
so today is not the fact , but you need to <unk> in <unk> and <unk> and mostly does it 's not scarce .
this introduction of <unk> result of all the market to regulate it does it also a single <unk> .
and now that 's how do you ca : so what do year , because i got the first question , and <unk> , this , is the situation for affected .
and there was just wo n't <unk> <unk> to read one , there <unk> , because i think , a society , always structures that legal structure , you 're all that <unk> what happens in our society .
and in <unk> article that 's just profound effect of people 's <unk> .
and the second , there 's going to protect the <unk> task of <unk> .

because a way , and <unk> from that case , i do other way , and i 'm somehow <unk> the power and then a very least i thought about what do , is because even die to you .
because year , `` yes , i think about the n't like we 're going to point .
hopefully the late , with hundreds or <unk> .
that 's in my profession that they 're going to say , that wish i mean , and i also worried , but eventually published by the theme we need to and then maybe that 's going to you 're <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , and so you already late in life to be late in life be able to say , i want to this question now i think .
if you now think about what makes my new jersey , the dots will be a year , <unk> , what are because actually cutting five of the things in my life . ?
so there 's a book was pretty <unk> <unk> .
there are the <unk> of course , but then the friends have in the <unk> and for health insurance wo n't seem to me through life <unk> , it 's <unk> .
it 's sure that trust between people who are you know what i mean <unk> , <unk> area or <unk> or <unk> , and other people in the relationship <unk> .
and it 's a lot of factors that there . <unk> i 'm now not all .
but if you these two points , look at the ground , a whole of how you 're in life , maybe <unk> to year , own going to protect .
and then there another factor that we need to <unk> the <unk> experience , i got this , as you 're getting richer than one .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior on <unk> , not meet .
this is conviction .
and i can only from ourselves out .
so it 's not the question , what you look for me , who will go over time , <unk> , or pay for me , who 's how to me to ?
but it 's <unk> to ask , where i can see people <unk> , where i can catch <unk> and my inside of <unk> 'm going with these questions could be rescued me , <unk> and <unk> .
and when he says , how we can be so this is this <unk> the outside <unk> was , it 's a way to say , i <unk> about my wife is like this mechanism i ca n't .
because no man can see <unk> , is asking ourselves to see <unk> want .

these questions about the year , just a long <unk> probably <unk> edit down .
this type of people 's the posture for me feel that 's not outside of can be able to the state to protect it 's law , and the whole other people <unk> , and more <unk> things , when i just there themselves before the <unk> 've got so we 're looking for a man .
and the conversation and takes it just spaces and there , and i tried to talk about , and here is that , are these spaces like <unk> the food , i 'm here , and on a picture of <unk> public spaces where we all these subjects to be a <unk> space is that 's not <unk> what 's also , <unk> , but not just a conversation was happening .
this , and then we are . say `` oh yeah , i dance , we may have , despite the kind of the age of that would still time .
you very welcome to your attention .
beautiful good evening .
and i two things with .
if you the first part of flat , and keep looking at a little <unk>
it comes a second .
we start with the <unk> .
that 's <unk> , not just take .
what you ?
there 's different <unk> ?
or is infinite enough ?
yeah !
that 's not good morning , which is one of what <unk> .
so , and i <unk> it , and we know .
so what we do n't .
we are only with a single .
and i border , like a little fact , <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> know , we <unk> they 're going to know .
and it for the <unk> . <unk> large amounts .
if we <unk> <unk> are counting your <unk> , in fact , for <unk> , in other people .
we need to suppose we already been looking at the box in the very small farmers are three <unk> and these people .
we can we <unk> , in the way that the elements in common ?
count how would we do it ?
that means we would just say , <unk> as well , three , we get the three , we count the <unk> , three <unk> as well , three , and three three years ago , and beautiful .
so , `` yes ?
very beautiful .
works in <unk> wonderful , that works , big numbers , <unk> .
but it does .
how we count ?
how do you know , <unk> , so many people like <unk> there are ?
i 'm aware <unk> and people , and not what else .
<unk> me !
's , .
you 're going to do n't think now we are on <unk> and understand that all .
do n't that 's very beautiful .
so it 's a professional class <unk> and it works , `` yeah ?
you know , and put a chair along the mouse .
time you <unk> of the time you <unk> this is all <unk> a different people get different <unk> , no chair of empty and large amounts of a big , okay ?
now we pushed <unk> .
so how two <unk> amounts each that ?
we would say that 's so much bigger or smaller than others .
we could we do it ?
and again , .
he 's wrong because the point is that she 's an infinite a lot , count , i would respond to say , they do n't other .
<unk> an infinite planes is that <unk> ?
so , how ?
<unk> ?
, <unk> .
they had n't just really started .
, .
so , now let 's time .
the informed estimate is <unk> always bad ?
so yes , `` no , yeah ?
the point is what it makes it .
so , for the <unk> take a natural numbers <unk> , we <unk> need to zero the ground zero tolerance , , five .
and we have the , a copy of <unk> and to copy of infinite you <unk> the way .
left to be just numbers , okay , zero , two years ago , eight <unk> ?
okay ?
this straight numbers <unk> on the infinite , the native natural numbers , but on the way the missing the <unk> the other are the straight and the <unk> on , okay ?
we call from a lot , a straight , we call the other things <unk> the natural .
what you think ?

this big ?
that 's a very <unk> yes , we 're missing in the <unk> .
and that estimate what ?
smaller ?
who says bigger ?
ah , which has to do n't have no plan ?
it 's not be yes ?
you can not going to what gets bigger , that 's how do <unk> ?
okay , and smaller ?
you think , right ?
this <unk> because they make it 's wrong .

how ?
exactly .
yes , .
that 's the point .
so , .
we take a zero from the straight lot of that we take a zero from the natural lot of time , figuring out .
one of zero , plus two , two , zero comes , and i get back <unk> .
four years ago , six years ago , eight years ago , yeah ?
you can also <unk> , it doubled , but it <unk> ?
and completely clear , is through the <unk> do we 're going to do , it in the lecture on a <unk> <unk> .
and here , there are just straight on and that , is equal , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural to the straight line <unk> the <unk> the way and that , but this year .
that there 's only in <unk> .
so if you some explain what we have today , the infinity , yes , what 's an infinite speed i know , finally ?

this . <unk> , they 're talking about three people are two people <unk> 's just a little bit about it 's three .
yes , with the infinity .
and none <unk> ?
okay .
then we still a second part of probability .
the professionals , <unk> probability .
it 's what brought
this experiment i 'm sure that 's least a third , and <unk> it makes a single person on , yeah ?
so we call the doors , b , c .
i 've actually something hidden , i hope that 's not .
and they should be first guess .
where i do you 've been something hidden lights behind , b , c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
so much , c .
who has this idea ?
a ?
who has this idea ?
<unk> , <unk> , b has <unk> to do n't otherwise , `` yes , but <unk> ?
so right .
it 's really , or so , but i 'm talking about four letters to fall , for me a .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it 's a completely clear that 's an opportunity to <unk> 're going to say <unk> , a third .
<unk> there are three things it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i do what i 'm just on .
well , i know , where it .
<unk> , that has taken someone <unk> .
so , i know , where it is , and guess what we estimate that , and it 's in a second round .
so i 'm now , the <unk> now this is just <unk> .
so it 's so , we go in a second round .
now suppose it , <unk> a mission that , <unk> ?
so we need a door to show you ca n't it 's how do n't have .
because they 're now , b , and i say and i know , yes , behind .
then there 's a second round .
then i say , <unk> from the mouse <unk> this .
but i think that 's <unk> , in the second round .
so i can just a <unk> left behind it 's not yet , but what they do n't have .
now is the question is the <unk> probability of the condition called the hidden under the condition , b on a lot behind the things you have now the last chance to try to guess .
they 've got to stay going to do n't necessarily a way .
i do now , what they want .
or you say , c .

<unk> , very beautiful , b is on that i know , it 's a c .
or even though god . thank you have b , has been , i wanted forever . '' remain , that it .
or would you can say , there <unk> , we have to <unk> the way i 've just two doors , right now it 's no , to change or in .
what you ?
it is n't matter .
<unk> .
why is n't matter ?
very beautiful .
why it 's why is it <unk> ?
yes , he 's wrong .
it looks like almost as if we yesterday <unk> we <unk> ?
but they 're going <unk> , are a new , no fun .
so , this whole thing is <unk> , yeah .
ca n't understand , and i do n't , and , yes , i do , <unk> in the else can i have no up to <unk> ?
so , it <unk> really happened .
behind the door is going to a third .
and it 's not just to a third behind the door .
you can guess what they want to you have two <unk> behind the <unk> .
that means you can on two doors guess what do n't you can be associated with <unk> do you can be on two dozen and then it 's <unk> the ground zero , <unk> , that there 's now , everything in life .
but we have just a door .
so , now is this is two , what does .
so it 's two here , but it 's just behind the door . .
behind it 's not .

, and i was hidden .

it 's better , in the climate change ?
now it 's , yeah ?
yes , it !
so , that was n't know , <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
they have <unk> this .
why ?
so , two are not hundred percent of the difference between the entire practice .
i hope it was for every time .
you .
mr. <unk> that they 'd like jamie <unk> <unk> to come here 's a bad diet and out , they <unk> of reported that we 're depressed here 's completely .
but i <unk> in my best thing to do afterwards , again , and <unk> .
i come in which is <unk> on both knew , twelve months at the mcdonald 's .
this time , <unk> , exactly .
yes .
thank you for the invitation .
i 'm here a up .
and i know i do . <unk> , so on with me to ask whether the spirit of lake up , and this particular topic to .
i got me <unk> <unk> this one of trust .
the motivation is also not bad and i <unk> the woman <unk> and said , perhaps the power , or later , sports .
about what is to have .

<unk> me up tomorrow 's rain this training , <unk> .
so who <unk> want <unk> , the early in the <unk> , i <unk> `` you all welcome .
i got to <unk> already said , i <unk> . <unk> sort of trust .
and i 've just started to deal with the subject <unk> .
do a nice little bit <unk> the blind , but afterwards <unk> .


trust in sports , the <unk> not taught me , <unk> and beer .
why tell me , the story . <unk> ?
now for a lot of the stories that i really excited by the country , from village . '' and grew with two great <unk> , with the oldest brother , the <unk> .
and with the second brother and the blind is like me .
but it looks <unk> and dark energy consumption can think is just too hard to <unk> window , it 's light , or .
what 's very practical , for the <unk> .
now , or we both can just ca n't have anything .
<unk> <unk> , but i 'll tell me , i can not from the <unk> man <unk> <unk> .
now , the old men <unk> .
and until <unk> <unk> .
and what 's a very critical of course , the fact , how <unk> you trust and <unk> just one of trust , that <unk> that we need to <unk> about <unk> that tell me .
and the good for my parents definitely know how many of them in my brother and i still have blind knew .
we were so , and then it 's in your life <unk> are .
and she had a lot of situation , what do .
and , now <unk> , and it 's a lucky , in my parents were farmers do n't all day after the next to stand each other hand , to lead to say there 's <unk> wall , there <unk> like , along the world , and then <unk> feel , where you <unk> .
and that uncomfortable , i looked at home , <unk> .
and b <unk> our parents are beginning to that encouraged , always a walk up with our <unk> brother .
so , in the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , it also the risk .

the <unk> the <unk> , until today .
so it with the big <unk> -- not just good for the <unk> , but for the <unk> .

and that the <unk> brother and i started with three years and then we wanted of -- michael and i .
and then started with <unk> go to get used to a little kids today with <unk> 's how do <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> ca n't .
but we 've got started with <unk> , without .
and then the big question : how <unk> ma , there ?
and how <unk> you trust , that trust her parents seem to the children also going back from your <unk> and <unk> and in the trust of us , <unk> you can drive .
and our solution was n't have to a lot of our parents , we 're starting point where are the <unk> , so where is a car , where <unk> <unk> , where are you have any <unk> things up houses , . right away -- i knew we do you are .
and in between orient to serve to realize that , too .
and that you can now here , unfortunately , test everyone else will , here , according to nothing more of this .
but <unk> the evening when it 's light , and in her bedroom , whose bedroom , and orient .
you can we 're just <unk> <unk> with the tongue , to orient and they find that 's associated with people just like , <unk> also -- they become a resistance .
so how the bats as a <unk> also you now <unk> a <unk> resistance because the sound of different <unk> .
and that 's going to trust , so we also in the movement , always very important .
but <unk> you high <unk> to have and the safety saying , i got to <unk> chance to be <unk> to help .
and i just to orient the great difficulty explaining it also , many accidents , the way or there 's not enough .
what i unfortunately , no pictures , `` i like this , that i <unk> ourselves a lot of our <unk> and children .

i got it 's written my confidence and also a <unk> diversity .
and my visual memory , literally , because i 'd be a lot more later , <unk> and in the <unk> to trust , and this is busy . '' i 'm about a thing , yes , i 've never <unk> it 's so experienced .
i did it 's never as you a read .
so , and also to do that it 's not everyone 's exactly <unk> experience .
it 's <unk> our strengths with that <unk> , is going to know , where i am right , what i talent and where i can just my strengths but also full <unk> ?
and our brother and again , the way to michael told me <unk> green roofs of house .
so then , okay , we <unk> a <unk> .

and the <unk> and then <unk> , michael behind and i did is probably still <unk> a little girl that 's <unk> <unk> i do .
but all you , and down ?
so i do n't .
and i <unk> visual effects <unk> , we 're passing generation of young men here , .
and so i 'd wait , but at mit .

because trust , and then the other <unk> .
and the father she said , god will be able to help to help africa , you about the biggest danger , you must be one of us too afraid <unk> , and in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> you know , you -- somehow <unk> .
is , but never happened .
he had then always <unk> that he said , and then slowly <unk> , or <unk> <unk> has to then <unk> .
and found that i was a great , and these opportunities .
but i do it 's not <unk> , <unk> , and later <unk> .
for me were different <unk> of my life forever , who were all , interesting .
and they were all the <unk> , because i just as you could : where you 're trying to look at borders would be so my <unk> .
so <unk> good <unk> 'd never be .
so i had never been <unk> .
and i go like to do n't like in <unk> .
i go , until today rather out of rain .
now , five degrees , right .
and <unk> rain , but rather than inside .
but i got these are still for me so that trust my strengths and i 'm going to <unk> try and it .
the first example , <unk> .
and that was for me , because there 's also <unk> of us in <unk> he said : ok , we have a louder <unk> , but , like us <unk> the blind children .
well , yes , because there <unk> you <unk> each of our own .
and then <unk> you know what the other .
and there was always looked at of course , when i <unk> long will and it 's hard , and the other perhaps , what do you do n't <unk> me .
so there 's just a method that 's the trust my <unk> .
the other <unk> a foot in the <unk> put me . backwards , let 's <unk> head , and then i went back and the <unk> is over there 's the full score .
i <unk> 's not test .
i had me about but <unk> .
i <unk> . this is <unk> a risky .
and i also a couple of volunteers ?
<unk> .
a great <unk> me .
okay .
next for me that was the school and then the <unk> and just <unk> .
my parents were home or are until today <unk> and that you may also , as children .
but i still a school , so important : how can tell you can also led to move the <unk> energy <unk> ?
and there was then as a way you <unk> .
and although i was always thought that 's all the visual <unk> boring , because <unk> is something for the <unk> rather than <unk> to me .
so that i used to -- <unk> `` i do n't .
i then eventually , right , i do with the <unk> .
and , and then i first to man , again , that 's the great diversity here in sports , <unk> it takes of <unk> of coordination and it <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> -- they probably things , a recognized ?
this is also <unk> .
you will only thing you 're just a full of their own art .
when you trust their own <unk> has been so the power to give you , and then , the conditions , bad weather , `` soft snow to <unk> snow , on the <unk> .
and if you in my case , and trust in liberal team has .
because as <unk> do n't see the course <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i never do <unk> happens like today -- i got word for example , <unk> -- there was , yes , it has done in my exercise .
it 's nothing we do n't yet again .
<unk> i <unk> , you might just the time .
do with a lot of a lot of them later this exercise .
what i get a lot of the <unk> trust is the exercise of the audience : so i 'll see , it 's when you see that <unk> , and with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> yes , you two sticks in the hand .
and therefore , it , `` i do n't raise more free , otherwise , yes , `` <unk> to feed themselves . <unk> <unk> .
not .
so i have to me to help .
i 've got my <unk> helped me , it .
and the for me with the voice bank , .
so i 'm just the exact <unk> .
and that 's important for trust .
the precision of communication goes into the <unk> .
and the <unk> me just always <unk> it 's <unk> going to me <unk> and <unk> , and says then based on stage 11 , you know it 's left , so , the top of the <unk> watch videos <unk> .
when he left on the little <unk> left , and when he says , right above 10 .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem because then i <unk> , he said , correct , you know , right now i did n't .
and for me , it , which is , <unk> , and then i have to be really completely <unk> it 's a negative to say .
it 's positive to say , he 's for me the tools , that it is , and then quickly , and in <unk> much faster than the same <unk> start .
and that i can see it 's just <unk> , with the poor , <unk> . <unk> 're going on a leg , to stand and i 've really have to make -- ha ha , you can also open , and yes .
and so then , so <unk> , and then on one leg and again and you here <unk> little <unk> , but i do you quiet .
also with high <unk> .
yes , and that 's for me it is that 's <unk> 'm just to <unk> it 's a guy to say , so i tell guy , because i actually just men as <unk> had to <unk> , it 's just to say : hey , `` me the right <unk> make a clear that looks like ourselves .
i 'm not going to tell me .
so i 'm <unk> to him in the communications , open .
and that 's like in each <unk> .
when someone who needs n't know , he said , and help but there 's not just asked to say : well , i need to take all the curve , <unk> <unk> used to <unk> .
or i need to take all right now , <unk> that i just as it says , how long as the mountain which is , <unk> <unk> , because you 're going to you need it over .
and , again , how <unk> and that thing , just not on .

and therefore , for me as important , there was <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
i listen to <unk> -- here there 's probably a lot of <unk> <unk> drive ?
who 's a more ?
so this time , faster , in september 21 now , in april this may there 's honest , so much faster . how <unk> .
and in the <unk> now , <unk> .
and for me , like i are these <unk> <unk> only possible if i just went to open . '' .
the other , and also tell you 're going to see , the opportunity to take risks perfect <unk> .
and that 's for me , very important things , i trust is more training , this <unk> <unk> .
so , `` well as a blind to do n't be honest , from <unk> .
because i believe that experience that 's a <unk> , and wrong <unk> .
and she was that in the <unk> the bad because the next week , three meters <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet just <unk> .
and therefore , like i was at the course <unk> on .
you know , because <unk> need to <unk> , so <unk> <unk> .
and to today , still <unk> to give me to say , and say , this : <unk> of the left .
and then there , unfortunately .
power of life often do n't .
but it in <unk> situation with pressure , that you probably also a lot of work or the , , when i 'll quickly go .
then , precision , yes <unk> <unk> hard challenge .
but for me like i mean <unk> trust , and that i want to know .
and there must be honest , i 'm as somebody has n't see , it 's an advantage because i <unk> to take risks in many ways .
so , <unk> <unk> i 've gone pretty much .
and drive <unk> tree from the <unk> down <unk> you know , and i <unk> , but it 's what it 's important -- i <unk> 're also have pages .
then , which then also in the if that trust , there is .
and when i found out that 's a hundred percent of <unk> , is it just need .
and i 'm not the same goals . '' .
because that is for me in the trust that time you that is .
you need the goal and i have to that 's also clear to it 's really trust you take ?
because it 's often <unk> faster and one time .
i <unk> , or the people enjoyed themselves .
but it is , in fact that 's also on .
that you ca n't trust , <unk> .
and that you 're also -- because we do with <unk> <unk> <unk> satisfy you want to <unk> sense that .
and the sense , which is often we 're just starting to <unk> goal together .
that we do -- in my case for example -- a couple of weeks , `` i 'm going on the <unk> .
and there <unk> `` i want to make sure now , for himself or the ministry in the case , we ca n't have just this mountain on top <unk> .
and how do you and then you 're on the mountain , eventually got up with ?
well , i had to be giants advantage we 've just some things do <unk> you look like , for me hundred meters <unk> .
then told me relatively <unk> .
so <unk> in order to <unk> `` no problem .
and i got these flies over the <unk> working effectively gone from the <unk> i 'm going to the u.s . '' i ca n't done <unk> <unk> i 'm in berlin <unk> the , because it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
is <unk> little <unk> if you set up there is to the cars now , you do n't much as individuals who have to be doing it hurts when i <unk> .
and these are actually more interesting .
it 's also <unk> to have but just starting to know : hey , the visual system that i 'm going to focus on <unk> you can just by the <unk> a new experience .
and indeed <unk> <unk> bit of <unk> , because it <unk> mountain <unk> yes , if you every 10 hours on in and forth , but eventually , just throw <unk>
you do it 's how do it has just throw stones , around , and plants .

so if you <unk> <unk> see , it 's the <unk> about the last one of the <unk> .
and about it 's not only exciting .
we have the <unk> only from the distance , or the other . .
and therefore <unk> in the <unk> big , in the <unk> -- despite his <unk> <unk> to help .
because i thought . '' : well , so i said , there <unk> `` i probably the way , how to the same thing <unk> .
but like , it 's otherwise , <unk> 's no wait for <unk> actually do n't really much change .
and really exciting , and then they 're saying something hard .
so if you look at the <unk> and it thinner .
or if the next day <unk> and then <unk> little <unk> , where the left , <unk> .
then , particularly beautiful and if it 's also night , and all the <unk> <unk> , it has taught us , <unk> , sometimes i said , and he 'd rather the wire to take to then i really look at the handle .
because i was only without <unk> there <unk> and that was him , but sometimes very risky .
we 've made of that i just said , `` well , i can be my <unk> in my friend , i was a hundred percent that i <unk> `` you and we 've been good <unk> .
but i need to also <unk> form of security to get <unk> focus on my life : can imagine if you look at the mountain , says <unk> , the right here on one on stage 11 .
there is that eventually <unk> a minute .
so for us , in the case , and we <unk> connection , so <unk> a rope off their <unk> <unk> , that i had a baby grew up behind her , <unk> <unk> rope <unk> .

and then eventually they , with the foot <unk> , <unk> or anything with her <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and i knew what to me <unk> and i <unk> just focus .
and what is just really . they 're actually of course , then eventually , there 's the <unk> you 're just this goal really in <unk> near the known as similar to be <unk> , with the <unk> .

but that trust is also other people who <unk> is to trust that works .
and then , just the mountain <unk> they were in the most people forward and behind us are the other seven in <unk> they were still a relatively dense behind us to go to pause for someone behind us and i 've already thought : tell me , `` stay alive because why <unk> because that everybody that he 's behind us run right ?
at you can also <unk> not from .
that 's kind of the reason apparently .
and then i did i 'm going to ah , ok , their trust your skills is <unk> also be pretty <unk> .
you know , through the dark , you about 12 clock started with the first of light .
that 's totally <unk> if you <unk> , the air , skinny , actually just <unk> and now , <unk> first .
and then , but eventually that moment where , said yes , that was really totally on board behind you go to the friend of me for that all , we have always <unk> -- how women , etc .
and we all night , anything , and the other international group , there , and facial recognition , <unk> to know , ok , it 's now , <unk> , that has one day .
and i got to produce different now , the mountain .
and indeed , it 's somebody else , if you feel bad about <unk> about what we have any time talking about it just <unk> half egyptian sun 's how soon .
and these things , and also to outside can trust , significantly to you can just try to you could be carried personal <unk> just too .
and now for trust and then given that 's not a perfect kitchen , so the personal <unk> and that we 're just really reach and then eventually , in the idea that there is .
that is clear across the sports with the gold , you <unk> -- i know , `` why <unk> do -- maybe i do n't the value and or at whether it 's just <unk> <unk> ?
so i <unk> these are some <unk> , in vancouver island , <unk> grams .
if you . gold would be <unk> , i 'm not be knocked on the <unk> , <unk> me .
or at <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but i 'm <unk> in the real , why you make it 's more like , you can imagine : what i did it was <unk> created and how i mean skills and we focused on a point .
how did i 'm going to my skills , but the team , that we need , or in <unk> in the job in the thing .
or old man or young woman , we need that people in the trust .
and if we then this goal in the two eyes , and that we 've seen or the proof that we at a project to trust .
and if you , once put it 's also , in other areas .
thank you
that for me is the title my <unk> to come from open-source movement <unk> to have maps .
what driving is that <unk> <unk> the <unk> again about <unk> in the general population growth <unk> .
and basically , be .
if i do <unk> <unk> there 's all <unk> just to transmit data subjects , the <unk> <unk> .
and everybody <unk> has a bandwidth of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where science , <unk> , somehow <unk> in .
everybody <unk> at least a <unk> any kind of subjects <unk> .
so , that 's totally <unk> if you <unk> it meant to make magazines and <unk> for children are sharing data subjects .
every program has somehow , own <unk> in <unk> , but it 's a pure <unk> story .
science is a thing we can i looked like <unk> you can i 'd say , but that 's me , itself .
cool thing is science just kind of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , somewhere , there are chemists cool . <unk> ?
and <unk> a <unk> five minutes , do anything with the reality to do that 's cool . <unk> ?
there 's going to identify .
in a <unk> , because i can about laughter , i understand the jokes lead , but it 's great .


but , that none of himself off .
i got a couple of examples of <unk> , like science , <unk> told us are <unk> .
and <unk> example : in london , you a beautiful tower , <unk> is an architect feeding time not just as we build this time somehow , so <unk> .

i went big through the press , there -- unfortunately , a <unk> .
, the heat , so <unk> that this poor <unk> there was really long has saved me , there are the <unk> <unk> .
she asks you that the architect , swami is not actually somehow , a bit of physics , because i mean , is completely rethink that a mirror , <unk> .
so what i found myself , very new york <unk> , somehow <unk> years <unk> , where he . they radiate to <unk> <unk> .
there 's what i really , which has been more design an architect , where he studied ?
this is a <unk> example .
a <unk> , which <unk> such of subjects in the <unk> .
<unk> , that 's already a few years , why is just kind of the media , and .
there was the train them <unk> , because <unk> the plants that was once a danger .
which was <unk> with , <unk> .
we were somehow what <unk> .
<unk> `` oh , there are genes in .
there were situations where on the market , really turned out : hey , and i <unk> vegetables .
no idea that means , and i yeah .
so , `` okay , <unk> tomatoes , , discussing .
but time i was kind of an active in the point , frustrated because i 've figured out of genes in my bacteria <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and she was totally frustrated that came home , and my <unk> neighbor , <unk> you see but not happy , what 's because what ?
i ca : yes , and there 's been three days as a little gene therapy with bacteria to transform and that works at .
this is what i 've been able to explain this kind of <unk> the genes , i thought , it 's a good , when i sort of genes and you know what happens when you , .
this is actually meant , so we sequence , there , <unk> <unk> they wanted .
but that is the woman <unk> .
this woman and again , the hand <unk> .
who knows exactly what i <unk> , <unk> ?
which is what 's <unk> .
that 's already have 10 years and yet it 's kind of consciousness <unk> .
we can see anyone what <unk> .
<unk> , so i have to do n't read .
it 's not always the technology , and it 's really our language <unk> of the
<unk> about europe was a a .
<unk> different , from corn , `` yes , , which contains .
in a lot <unk> in rats used to die .
yes , that was also a nice <unk> .
there are not old and it 's also , no , which , i 'd be ways .
or the most important to talk about the <unk> .
there 's not <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm talking about it takes bit more time .
but a lot of uncertainty while population and they 're just do with the subjects <unk> .
nevertheless , in our future , like that technologies are .
now was just <unk> , nobody had big on the subject , but it 's about things <unk> and this is what people do n't really did .
and that 's pretty sad .
how can do this information from the lab in the population ?
if we that little bit , <unk> , sitting in his lab with an <unk> something very beautiful and good , and he <unk> thinks that person is , what we 're interested in public .
then the first of professor .
the head , decides it , okay , <unk> subject pairs of his name on the <unk> , that 's always important in the science <unk> .
good idea , i 'm still not in public transport it 's a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> . oh great idea of class , because we do a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , because we have a <unk> with a project , a nice idea and that comes ... somehow get out of <unk> .
that will then <unk> yes , who do ?
now , the rare in fact , have multiple <unk> a common <unk> , a common <unk> .
and from all these are , and <unk> , which is really cool , and then over the <unk> the magazine in the <unk> , took leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> are .
so that way .
so on the it going on <unk> in the <unk> up until 1998 , really cool and then there are really <unk> projects go in these <unk> up .
that <unk> <unk> magazine , there are really well done , there 's of all there 's free , but who <unk> do ?
and basically just like to care .
in the <unk> we call , <unk> the <unk> .
so the other <unk> you 're interested in <unk> then the newspaper , `` beautiful and good .
a magazine provides a major demographic fact , for these seem to talk about this idea of the <unk> it 's even in these <unk> .
who <unk> to do n't really ?
the <unk> -- it <unk> interested .
now , that was now , yeah , <unk> <unk> , i call him , mr. <unk> <unk> is an underwater -- and <unk> read , i tried a neutral to be <unk> do n't really .
yet entered again , our future will we just kind <unk> , if with these <unk> are .
fracking . <unk> using renewable energy , <unk> there are all of the <unk> that mr. <unk> but not really understand and when he knows <unk> do .
my project , my idea is therefore , <unk> this little bit of highly motivated to get out of <unk> , really completely his normal <unk> to separate from him out of course , a seminar . science <unk> <unk> .
what 's mostly in a scientist who have a buddy , we have been well , and he 's <unk> , it 's taught us a <unk> rule it in his job to avoid questions .
once , <unk> and his job , with us <unk> .
<unk> , that scientists tell you think about <unk> .
<unk> it sounds <unk> look at <unk> , <unk> 's almost the same level of genes .
<unk> treated , that 's kind of oh , you do n't see behind .
we really teach <unk> bacterial cell , that 's beautiful and good , if you go on a conference , and there -- and your <unk> on a <unk> anything you want to you can you 'd like <unk> , but <unk> still respond to tell you just water .
where is the problem , it really <unk> the normal to talk ?
i school , and that 's my idea , these young scientists been so far in the hierarchy <unk> are still a little <unk> to school , how <unk> <unk> .
that has for all you can use <unk> the way of investors who want to know , in the <unk> happened .
eventually are also <unk> of being used to be that i have actually also <unk> communicate .
but of these training , that 's just a story .
so then also really interested in <unk> you want to your project , you have a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> be honest , even worse . n't have kids .
there 's a quote , i do n't whether it 's kind of albert einstein said , if you do we can do you do n't really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab , and her project began to rethink about how can be normal <unk> communicate ?
so , there 's already <unk> .
<unk> are the modern , it to live in the university <unk> , there <unk> and basically , again <unk> .
and the first time <unk> the end of the university some <unk> , <unk> on trying to <unk> <unk> what ?
that we <unk> interested .
to put my <unk> .
so , that the people . <unk> for the way to drive , every single <unk> i .
that 's beautiful , there are any <unk> done all are satisfied . they 're happy to drive home and that 's .
so <unk> , i was a second aspect of time to say , it 's not , <unk> the project .
these scientists are also <unk> , how <unk> actually children ?
because they really <unk> that we 're trusting , to reduce .
because scientists like the research and how to their world , we look identical .
we 're doing that scientifically .
they do anything to learn to walk .
they try to be able to work ?
<unk> don’t fall that , does n't think of repetition to change a couple of course , i still a new .
children learn that scientifically .
that are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> , the factors i 'm going to make it works or not .
that 's normal .
but that have <unk> .
and therefore , i really work , if you look after the <unk> , and these scientists permanently in the neighborhood centers in the environment with the kids out of kindergarten , <unk> there , together to make children , whose <unk> , and there really , and <unk> because i 'm going to the children born scientist , basically the same language .
and then you might be eventually , that 's so my hope to tell the children , then at home , and then <unk> , mr. <unk> , and then also , for the most interested in the children him .
that 's not anywhere in the newspaper that 's not anywhere , galileo , but his children tell him , it <unk> mirror , <unk> working on that it 's a bread <unk> has working on paper <unk> to do then , and shake off and head of the architect , to build .
and not just <unk> money , mr. <unk> but also the <unk> .
that 's my idea of my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it 's still in the first <unk> paper called `` i said yes , so , <unk> for our scientists , that 's a compassionate theme that we just other priorities .
and scientists have n't communicate .
now , i think , and then , okay , you . i the next day .
but who knows the institute who <unk> is in a company , there are the next break .
you .
i went mad at the question .
we can not every day .
the past weeks of awful .
weather has the bottom of <unk> done .
years ago , as soon eight years , i asked , i want to take it .
i was the ceos , almost 10 years , <unk> <unk> in <unk> and in <unk> .
so there are quite far to come .
and <unk> the client .
and for me that was actually , `` well , this <unk> .
what do ?
<unk> , that 's a ridiculous .
i did then we 've learned is that 's why i here today .
and maybe it 's a little nuts , but it 's there , `` emotional .
it 's beautiful and always exciting and makes great fun .
and i 'm just in the next <unk> , <unk> minutes , from this , <unk> .
and ceos in <unk> .
the company is a hundred and <unk> years .
and ceos , <unk> .
this company , so since , years .
and ceos , <unk> .
the company 's been <unk> or <unk> years .
the <unk> the <unk> zero <unk> .
<unk> .
and it , i 'm going to do this is , right , that 's actually a red , is a <unk> on , like that we do n't know exactly this point is a big .
there 's a worldwide . <unk> <unk> .
and are actually just now , the action .
we already happening .
there 's about , to active to <unk> .
this is , no market .
that 's also not a <unk> .
that 's a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why do you 're really ?
it 's going ?
<unk> in our and just the action , because it afterwards , talk about why this is .
and then the story .
<unk> has a of crazy <unk> <unk> the <unk> i started .
in short <unk> .
has to <unk> fourteen , for the war , <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
then the first world <unk> <unk> died actually <unk> and <unk> were about <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
we have to london <unk> and so forth .
and as we <unk> and eight of london to be a big <unk> a <unk> campaign to fly behaviors were the english newspapers <unk> full of <unk> : this time they 're not bombs , but in <unk> intent .
it has the story , and <unk> .
and we had a <unk> campaign .
but <unk> , the client was not very pleased to him very clear of the world , that was kind of memories in there <unk> .
and well , and wait for the <unk> , critically .
but it was in london a good , except weather in up there was 15 years , bad and very <unk> .
and we are not very much the .
and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> hugo <unk> that , taken .
and has a <unk> <unk> we 're going to america <unk> .
that has a <unk> <unk> , that all the german nation , once again something felt like , which <unk> and <unk> that <unk> kidnapped .
there was in a new york , with <unk> .
and all the german nation 's up with <unk> , we 'd marry .
this is in all <unk> so , and that 's really important for a bit of <unk> of this device .
but actually are going to <unk> and <unk> only five years ago , seven <unk> , there were built and only really big , the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> a hundred people around <unk> <unk> and <unk> it up with <unk> <unk> .
it was but a <unk> .
and the <unk> then that person to live <unk> crash , there , unfortunately , <unk> .
and the titanic that event , which is an icon of a product <unk> , and then also never , <unk> .
and the devices , and .
and <unk> , <unk> the last couple <unk> <unk> , .
the materials used for <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
then i had nothing about <unk> years .
and then we had <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that had the idea , maybe you 're going to
and i was and <unk> , which technically a brilliant product in get a lot of the market .
now , he is the market ?
what is there is actually go ?
this .
it now .
the <unk> <unk> , that is , the <unk> , we <unk> yes <unk> it 's still <unk> , which has a lot .
are many companies , from this <unk> that are .
it 's <unk> employees , around , billions <unk> .
that 's a real <unk> very high <unk> .
there 's a lot behind .
let me then , i 'm here come up .
the <unk> to put it 's actually a the plane , each other airplane , but i 'm sorry , <unk> a gas , <unk> , hydrogen , and <unk> also a <unk> with <unk> .
's like , and in water , and in there 's <unk> do .
it 's now , there is , in detail to explain .
inside a <unk> , with a structure .
there <unk> of <unk> .
there 's <unk> <unk> , that we 're going <unk> in the case , <unk> .
and it 's no structure are kind of <unk> in <unk> .
one of the <unk> the world has a few years <unk> , <unk> piece .
and there are today , is earlier , and then <unk> in our minus our own that , so , then , .
what the production , when a <unk> <unk> .
so this again .
and the <unk> 's also <unk> .
comes from <unk> .
origins , the <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> then there are the <unk> .
in one <unk> two million euros , <unk> .
and we have to <unk> be able to <unk> , and has <unk> to go to be at the same time , <unk> , would be a hole that it wo <unk> .
there 's the <unk> again <unk> to look at exactly how to put holes .
and up with a <unk> , <unk> look like it 's .
the <unk> there 's technically a <unk> .
and that you see here are numbers , very short time .
one <unk> nine percent of one <unk> nine percent of one <unk> , four percent <unk> , which means of a thousand flights in the fall , <unk> .
that 's very little and very good .
now that <unk> .
we can see .
but there 's a new trend us , the power to have gone up here <unk> .
we had three years ago <unk> percent <unk> i started four years ago <unk> five plus eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> the last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may we were taught <unk> percent .
if you eight years , eight years , <unk> <unk> and <unk> it <unk> and then you can say , in these eight years of course , <unk> the <unk> we also clear in eight years has weather clearly changed .
we are <unk> .
we can be <unk> it 's fog fly .
i want to happen .
and the world <unk> or <unk> they actually , the ground .
so a little bit <unk> a lot of our weather , felt <unk> , statistically , because we do weather every day changes .
but because this is , this is that the e.u a program <unk> <unk> , almost 10 million euros and we are a <unk> of program .
i come morning , from finland .
that <unk> is here <unk> it 's a flying lab .
<unk> called the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between earth and <unk> feet .
it means <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> t flies in italy , , or finland in a <unk> <unk> .
so many many hundreds <unk> 's , and analyzed the air force . <unk> see , and on the amount on the do .
there , and she explains the end up there are on the second <unk> .

and so if you want <unk> <unk> out of the weather .
that 's a very good .
and here are just a few <unk> .
that <unk> in sweden last week or <unk> week .
and in finland is weather , and <unk> , <unk> degrees above 30 degrees .
the <unk> say , they had seen .
i 've got there 's wonderful , and <unk> days .
these mosquitos and then you ca n't so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have de <unk> as <unk> <unk> for a better and volcanoes for the <unk> that <unk> are represented <unk> a million years .
we can also important thing that 's all africa , as well , <unk> if you want to ask , was to ask me to ask a sense of time in cinema in the film <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i 've been to ask , what do n't mean ?
and what support we do ?
and we were two years , also done .
the <unk> and then it on .
the whole <unk> , and then <unk> and that project was then .
and a tornado , the <unk> the mast , and so <unk> , that he also have to stay .
i 'm not bad .
we had a very good insurance industries were actually be happy .
that was in the prototype .
and i did n't really what i do .
yes , what we do this to <unk> a lot of <unk> .
what we do it 's just to do it 's complexity is the growth or that .
what we do is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do <unk> .
so we need <unk> forever .
<unk> means <unk> .
there are now , and these devices in the ten chances <unk> , again , the replaced to be .
we replace it all <unk> for almost 10 million euros .
there with the clients <unk> talk about it .
we do we have <unk> constantly .
we are a <unk> <unk> <unk> to come from the germans <unk> and approved in the control it will always meaningful and <unk> , with <unk> how <unk> , or a <unk> .
that 's also <unk> external costs money and this is also get .
the question is , you actually go ?
you go to ?
so bigger <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
what makes you 're really ?
you 're in the market ?
you 're going to <unk> ?
and that we now , in my time to try .
and we have some <unk> <unk> .
the way , <unk> <unk> some <unk> <unk> , and <unk> broke down .
at the <unk> stood still <unk> of <unk> .
of the german population has it was saved with six million <unk> as <unk> , in the fourth <unk> <unk> , and he basically broke a lot of him <unk> done .
and it 's going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and the other companies that everybody else we <unk> or <unk> i <unk> , and other companies would n't there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were they 're losing our lives in san francisco to customers .
that was a very <unk> <unk> .
both these are unfortunately failed .
so , <unk> .
simultaneously , we <unk> .
there was no image , because we 're <unk> <unk> to show .
but just in america 's now , <unk> , <unk> in the finished .
we have a piece .
and <unk> way we 'd like a business partner , the new .
and that 's great success , but even defeat . .
but customers are basically <unk> , it 's not .
why was not ?
we know it .
i was the location of the right or <unk> had to get far <unk> or in america , did you <unk> the last 30 <unk> years , and it .
the <unk> people have <unk> , so we <unk> we have said <unk> , again , and <unk> there was an advertising .
there , we do n't know that there <unk> .
and it was actually , and marketing team over the : hey , i looked flies .
<unk> 's good .

but last year we 've just <unk> to the weather .
there is somewhat equal to a .
that 's a bad .
the <unk> flies <unk> routes .
it 's the sense of course is , and ceos to see how the <unk> <unk> and , and all laughing and we basically , not advertising , it 's mouth open mouth , again , about <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the people say , that 's beautiful , and <unk> it by the known for whom it is a family .
and we are <unk> .
one , again <unk> the character mistake i think we are <unk> .
you might be more <unk> .
we have a <unk> the <unk> to be <unk> .
that , not .
we do not advertising .
that 's time , <unk> been a <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> that , right here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> little bit harder market .
and so sometimes , <unk> imagine : power in certain sense ?
we 've never actually do advertising on the internet has changed the <unk> the launch , because the <unk> everything .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , so there 's just heard the active <unk> in the world .
we 've got here .
the active , <unk> , that <unk> three years <unk> bought the ten million active .
so then six months ago .
that means we then the market , if it does n't get it .
and hope it also have a future <unk> .
and the end : scott , of kamenj was the apollo <unk> of his <unk> paris <unk> years ago , he said <unk> the walk on the <unk> what <unk> .
so <unk> is beautiful .
and do we also .
now , whether customers .
<unk> to do , it has a technological things .
there 's customers .
that 's not the .
it 's <unk> it goes up .
and i <unk> five years ago , if <unk> .
and then back , no .
so there 's funny , which is easy for the hard to control .
there is that the situation , <unk> , a point in <unk> , so , no market .
yet we do on .
it 's a great region .
the <unk> solar power of it .
they 're just the question : in the shape we do it ?
how much money 're going to <unk> ?
what do what do for here ?
in which is the <unk> ?
and i personally , i asked her own personal to say , the next to <unk> <unk> , where the place <unk> <unk> i was a big <unk> , <unk> that , and <unk> dead , there 's also here 's salvation .
i was also think about greenpeace three years <unk> in the vancouver island . 'm giving speeches of the <unk> <unk> 've got to me that <unk> , that i 'd like `` i do .
and then , <unk> about greenpeace actually spend money <unk> do n't know what you can make should be almost to basically that are .
there are now , <unk> , when it 's <unk> .
and i 've spent about greenpeace <unk> as <unk> and now i 'm here in the hope for future , <unk> .
zero , which is this <unk> seconds , and yet done before .
<unk>
yes , you .
my two points , in the <unk> minutes <unk> want .
why are today , <unk> or in abundance ?
so , <unk> ?
and what do ?
we 're here 's really ?
let our first point .
the first part is perhaps a little <unk> .
but it also <unk> of those challenges .
a few years ago about a little bit harder it 's a to explain .
and a problem now , every child .
and environmental movement .
but it 's been over time , and <unk> there are the challenges that <unk> example .
all kinds <unk> these exponentially <unk> .
if you 're in a historical long view of the <unk> for example , that a very short episode of have .
now we can be , i saw more than that <unk> go on up .
you know climate change the last <unk> years .
some people , `` used to the time <unk> , let the last <unk> years .
you can also <unk> look <unk> i mean , right .
you can also say , who takes a glacier ?
you can also an ocean is far away .
but it 's already , if you a bit more so busy to take a real challenges to make it really of is something else , we have trouble with <unk> the health .
<unk> , there 's about 30 degrees .
and the degrees ' in our cities like in vienna , <unk> this is increasingly , and so bad .
it 's also the <unk> , in asia .
think about the <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> that there <unk> water from the <unk> coming .
it 's all , the planet .
the planet is that <unk> we 're doing , there was a lot of crises .
and <unk> , but it 's going to a lot of a couple of <unk> ecosystems , <unk> life .
it 's loss of biodiversity .
the deserts <unk> of .
that <unk> and less .
so that <unk> , where a <unk> part of cotton from .
and it comes straight from ?
all bad things tell me , and the world , or shape with the global <unk> together .
and we 're <unk> from the earth , what we harvest .
now , the oil and the metals out of minerals to measure renewables resources are really <unk> , but all scarce .
and we should just look , and so as we consume , when we all of waste our emissions . .
it 's about that 's in the <unk> already in the whole <unk> really dramatically , to reduce .
that 's the challenge is not only climate , c <unk> two <unk> a car on a different species really differently , to live .
so exciting economies .
our technology , the change .
if we 'll just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , and it 's always been earth , which is basically used to come with a <unk> resources the year per person next year .
in a <unk> was interested in the <unk> time of human history three to 10 tons .
today , <unk> to <unk> .
so <unk> of this <unk> .
and he 's very , <unk> the earth .
it 's in north more than us , more than the earth <unk> .
and in other parts of look at africa , very much less .
and then we <unk> the impact of us , it 's much better , in the last decades but it 's essentially , it , in other parts of the <unk> .
and the other parts , let 's a less like .
and so are also military conflicts could see the amount of <unk> this is in afghanistan , where do you look at the <unk> the american <unk> survey and then you see , where the resources come .
and that there is there 's <unk> , which means are many resources , where the <unk> the world .
so when we <unk> want to be with the subject <unk> .
so we need to change the ecological limits everywhere . <unk> is everywhere .
and that we 're looking at <unk> life that 's not <unk> .
that has inspired by mahatma gandhi were when he said , the world has enough for everybody needs , but for everybody greed .
and there are we have the national average life that , about .
this .
and that this <unk> part .
but i think about that it to understand it 's also trying to change .
when asked afterwards , and it 's also , and so , like , which is <unk> .
but it 's but again , and <unk> <unk> , but a rationale for that tell me over time .
so what 's actually <unk> ?
and there have to find that we 're rich many of creating a very economically viable <unk> high quality of <unk> with us , often do n't know <unk> .
here 's a pretty good mood , but there are people , and i 'm going to do n't know as a deal with this story .
i 've heard that there .
<unk> and climate across the same cause .
we work , and <unk> .
so on the get ourselves to stress management and eventually it 's much .
i work , like .
and other side , we just this <unk> .
but what is a good life ?
so how to define ?
now this is a scientific <unk> .
and we 've been said , and what i later i 'm a scientifically , <unk> , but here is it 's just <unk> the way , so first define ?
and there is important to understand quality control over two aspects .
quality of the aspect of objective conditions , i 'm going to eat .
i 'm on the head ?
there friends ?
there , i keep in ?
but i also see here i 'll show you 're going to deal ?
i <unk> like that sometimes the <unk> quality .
and then <unk> these two <unk> <unk> the demand for the important .
the needs .
it needs of the fundamental to our human development assistance , there . <unk> to take emotion .
if our needs <unk> we 're happy .
and needs can not everyone needs are sustainable or not sustainable .
our definition se , ready for instance <unk> .
what are needs ?
so many scientists . it was kind of it .
and there are in the physical . but also need to the social relations .
and protection . <unk> , <unk> of creativity , spirituality for freedom .
it has a bit after money that .

and there are the second important term .
and strategies .
the strategy , i use the available in order to me to their needs to satisfy us .
and here 's already <unk> as well , so with a high <unk> or with a low <unk> do .
there , much money , or money .
strategies , we 're just to behave like my needs <unk> .
that has with my values to do with the resources into the stock options .
if i money , <unk> `` i saw my needs to try to <unk> as if i so much money on the <unk> .
it 's all around the <unk> it 's the roof over the head to eat , and then , and <unk> .
and here . then <unk> . from a little <unk> . a sustainable either <unk> .
and if we all the strategies , to stand up my needs to <unk> , <unk> it 's a lifestyle .
this .
and that a scientific <unk> .
and now here <unk> so what we do ?
how about how this ?
and there , just some evidence .
of course , starting to keep ourselves .
but the evidence to the individual , on a technical , here 's a <unk> `` i was also about technology , '' and finally starting on a political .
so what do ?
so what do ?
what do we ?
so , where we might go ?
the slides , and so , the biggest danger is n't have a couple more consumption more resources consume .
all the quality of <unk> because the effects '' worse things , so on us all back to be .
or whether we do a lot of other direction . with less <unk> , perhaps also less consumption , with a higher quality , connected .
so there 's a community <unk> , maybe for him some of <unk> of <unk> of this topic <unk> , so the quality care less <unk> .
so here 's talk about how can each one thing that we can use , and <unk> a coffee car , the traffic , how can i want to produce ?
<unk> i can be different things that house , <unk> build <unk> <unk> .
the , less <unk> more or the same quality control .
my other teachers <unk> <unk> that , so in the <unk> per <unk> there 're talking about this is also , <unk> has been , because here , deep for the top of companies to look .
where are actually the needs ?
and services can actually <unk> ?
and how can do with you know <unk> do ?
and i with a little less , with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there 's many examples include thousands of them .
in vienna , a tower has become friends , <unk> .
with seven <unk> is it in <unk> already built .
that essentially from <unk> is .
that you know if you might be <unk> years longer need <unk> , and then he <unk> and not so on a lot less resources <unk> with other family comes out there , right now , and that goal is a fifth of <unk> the whole <unk> , we have the fifth of <unk> long .
it 's also , in our own a lot <unk> `` i mean ?
<unk> <unk> has a beautiful book written by <unk> .
where he shows how to all is a really lot of this from that <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> want to me , <unk> the other , and then i 'm so , in this case , race in .
you put themselves as a <unk> , there fast <unk> 's a visual , new .
the most <unk> `` i <unk> you know you all .
and my institute -- i did some years ago , we love letters .
then , you , wait , until the letter <unk> to write `` i <unk> email , is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
they write a lot of emails .
and i can lot more afford .
that is productivity , that growth , we have to .
but i did n't really have saved .
i got me , and <unk> done .
there 's good examples of slow <unk> for instance where i really , the <unk> the quality of <unk> the <unk> in the foreground , .

one of the <unk> .
the best-selling , you <unk> that <unk> average person us in germany , <unk> about <unk> the average household .
you 'll start to count .
who years ago , three generations <unk> things that his employees military personnel .
and we were the <unk> .
we ourselves with <unk> .
and fewer people come to do with these all options .

about these <unk> `` i really is perhaps also <unk> out the spaceship , go to <unk> `` i do n't <unk> things .
next example , instead .
a real boom .
star , <unk> , <unk> improved so maybe 20 , billions of labor drives alternatives , evolved .
in the meantime , and more people , if you <unk> thinking .
if you 're <unk> thinking .
platforms such <unk> , just going to work how do you know , we have this beautiful <unk> here at a few hundred years , a lot of the most importantly , in centuries , what 's all .
it has invested in the better , .
that 's all the question of justice .
i did n't been shown this is <unk> that 's just come from between africa and europe , a <unk> world .
this is the same with these resources <unk> can not only possible if we clearly they consume .
and that is just not the quality of a lot <unk> , and so much .
but it 's important task , a company , these products and services , to do we need to take us a good life to make them , less resources .
last it 's also has happened with the policy to do <unk> the growth <unk> like this time .
if you a little attention to <unk> and then <unk> , oecd countries <unk> right now , <unk> every week , <unk> back down <unk> .
it 's a crisis is the door up , and also , we 're a lot of economists said , and so busy in the numbers for <unk> , they find out on for all of growth , just down .
it 's no reason that growth and so i think is that my youth from the <unk> you know .
part that , and it reasons .
one <unk> five percent growth is so much like eight percent growth , <unk> years .
and that eight percent increase in india today .
there are also , there , where perhaps we 're <unk> years .
<unk> you look at a bigger question is harder to take eight percent <unk> .
and it , but if you 're good <unk> .
but you 're so on hire people that means not even if we zero percent growth in <unk> , yes , the next year , so much , and consume and income countries like this year .
ca n't . well , and so we can work .
that 's also like that wrong , these statistics , the next growth in fact , `` do with the quality .
the economy grows , but the quality of years ago , <unk> countries , i stood up on .
and their jobs are also without growth , and literally ca n't look closely with me , again , <unk> and how they all the <unk> .
that , and then the time with the economics <unk> .
and it again , and they 're also <unk> how <unk> the next week , <unk> `` i mean , the trend is a story with this topic . <unk> .
so <unk> that edward <unk> , the <unk> of his <unk> with <unk> that he said , that part of the good , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> life .
what 's all about it does n't <unk> . <unk> to make it <unk> significant growth is what we are n't even more about .
in peru and these countries , china for india there is that <unk> other story .
and that 's only <unk> also under <unk> , and there , still growing around and we just so on this level of our planet , high level , and we 're still life and economies .
it takes the public policy .
it takes goals .
it takes <unk> at the economists .
it takes on this growth , but we should really look like , and ask ? '' actually with the quality goes up with iphones ?
so that down ?
and also our politicians measure .
of the right here <unk> ?
how do this together ?
we need to the aspect of the fact , <unk> finally , <unk> and not the work .
of you especially those entrepreneurs who , but also <unk> you know that very good .
what , where taxes <unk> know , we did a and paid .
that could be different .
resources are a reduced and so the resources <unk> and not the work .
and all sorts <unk> <unk> to employment to make juice <unk> to <unk> health , without growth .
now , but there , a little <unk> .
that means so , which is all levels , in this working to be able to <unk> we live in the right services and services as consumers of us questions , what we need to understand how do we know what is a good for us ?
what we need and what we need not ?
the right politics , the <unk> sat down .
some evidence there .
and all of the science <unk> percent of <unk> 's still in the direction so how exponential growth <unk> ?
, but none .
if <unk> that if you look at the last , and it down because it 's about .
politics do n't seem to <unk> will not growth , which is the question how we 're going to do n't have a good life of ?
so , <unk> to do it .
be the <unk> called <unk> to lake .
the heart brain , your hand and all of the <unk> we going to need .
you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this town .
this city has many stories .
of a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative <unk> .
this creative <unk> that same way , and on the story about later .
they 're going to do n't have with the <unk> <unk> .
that 's <unk> <unk> here in the middle city of these things that 's also , and <unk> .
another story about .
it was a hot <unk> in <unk> as well , .
a man <unk> , once in his <unk> , right , right <unk> .

he 's europeans , he knows that does with the heat .
he then one he pulls the <unk> from a <unk> <unk> too long <unk> in a <unk> power of these holes in .
he pulls the <unk> again , this is <unk> , and <unk> he has a new , in <unk> .
it 's the <unk> , the <unk> was born .
and this number of this is , in the <unk> the <unk> the morton bast <unk> today .
a company is <unk> that , with four letters .
the marketplace or of you know it .
he has the original idea that nike and <unk> , .
both have -- .
so he says , right , <unk> , i do my own company .
<unk> about his alibi location in .
busy for several thousand people who are scarce <unk> <unk> in <unk> the world .
so much , creative <unk> .
why not something new to do n't there is ?
and bast way to be the question its height of <unk> <unk> .
if you <unk> n't know it 's for what is that opportunity ?
this question , and it 's helped a very difficult situations .
when something wrong <unk> or my <unk> <unk> , or technology does n't , .
<unk> a little memory , <unk> .
what is that opportunity ?
and you 're <unk> into <unk> .
what that difference can <unk> to collaborate with this example illustrate .
and another example , the <unk> <unk> collected a lot <unk> of the <unk> .
and prove that , creative people . when it your own insurance .
i want a few examples here .
there are actually , so <unk> , and <unk> <unk> and the way to make a <unk> done .
i <unk> as a fantastic .
my son has the woman , <unk> .
he 's just <unk> this is the woman , <unk> <unk> .
or i had the all day of <unk> the intersection . '' and suddenly , <unk> in my <unk> and i could one <unk> n't see .
so , who are not the right ?
the <unk> .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , and two , almost died .
there can tell you least suggests half <unk> <unk> .
that i was a crash your fault .
the was the young woman in <unk> .
if you a man who 's one another explanation <unk> .
if you have a woman who understand it . <unk> n't .
so people are creative process , we are creative .
and i wish , i dream that we all more of the creativity .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that n't .
why do n't think differently ?
the things we do , <unk> part of us to tell you <unk> or <unk> the opposite .
why do n't respond to do n't know <unk> a little simple <unk> .
and so there 's so <unk> companies to use this .
for example <unk> , there , but this <unk> their <unk> in these signs in off for example , and there then perhaps the .
also a way , right ?
and the coffee , and instead of <unk> .
or what .
we have no <unk> , <unk> you .
say today , <unk> right ?
if you look at not something type .
or eat them to me something else <unk> we both .
<unk> highly creative .
it takes 's .
i talk about visual of the clients ' <unk> and then go , and say , okay , like .
that <unk> `` i .
a <unk> <unk> has to look <unk> the recent <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
the sports , and news for politics .
if you are three on the <unk> , you <unk> .
once in the main complaint about . <unk> the food .
it 's a <unk> building a restaurant very small , so we 're chefs , hands of that .
it was very closely .
we have about being able to do we ?
how do we the problem ?
ca n't make up in the kitchen .
this idea is that .
there is going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> fresh <unk> molten <unk> and a <unk> .
so i realized <unk> in the <unk> on the food , <unk> , the <unk> .
just a different .
a creative stuff , and you with the <unk> .
there 's a person in that are currently , popular .
so this person is the leader of <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .

the second day , that takes a monday , so four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> male employees during <unk> elected , and they know , as you .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , thank you .
the people come to <unk> <unk> .
the buses , we 're full of it will <unk> <unk> to organize an <unk> because of course , in the brain , from a b to come .
but why not too <unk> something , and creative from his disadvantage do something ?
sometimes i think creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> maybe we like this company , that you might know .
so we have to <unk> to begin with <unk> n't really good , but you to the <unk> i save this is something <unk> .
or the <unk> the car .
you know , yes , and <unk> , and all directions .
yeah .
why not a piece <unk> the car the if you <unk> is ?
or the <unk> there 's also have to be to .
and all that has to do the humor , with joy and sometimes it 's <unk> , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son , in office .
and sitting on this <unk> to me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the <unk> .
and then so he left , and he joy and i in my <unk> <unk> tell me to do you listen to say yes , playground .
he said , look at the big eyes around the playground .
the moment <unk> `` i was actually he said , right ?
why is a playground .
so why we 're doing is not the playground for adults ?
what about me , <unk> right ?
if we feel relaxed right into our talents to do that we can do .
and so <unk> the very much more relaxed him .

it 's the first day in the week and it 's our focus on a day .
so other day we now , rather .
so the weekend .
it sounds , yes , already in the media .
the <unk> `` yes , just a day of the weekend .
or if we <unk> a year announced the <unk> .
what are the rest <unk> a year ?
it 's an awful ?
we have all the <unk> jobs ?
a <unk> had it on the cover us , this topic .
that 's monday , `` i and i wanted to ask ourselves .
on <unk> on facebook , everywhere in the social networks and this topic <unk> .
once <unk> i go through the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a business and i look , i love .
we have the way to look <unk> , which is there ?
and one day <unk> , this business with these <unk> a button .
and the sign that you see here , `` yes , very nice .
so , from that i do instead .
i <unk> , yes , i 'm about five kids , but i love with my work now .
yeah .
we still <unk> for <unk> is that <unk> sign .
why the attitude , there 's degree <unk> , and again .
somebody else , as a answer . <unk> , it 's monday , your jobs .

what my job is beautiful ?

so something beautiful to talk a beautiful thing about it clearly not .

there 's just a wonderful to fly it 's what else in the land .
but <unk> <unk> they did n't .
where we have n't change ?
and job interview , our <unk> ?
within of the outside of <unk> .
it ends , in a system where we like us feel like the mouse .
mouse up here in this wheel left , and it was running , and eventually it 's very quickly , and , it 's the poor , and they <unk> out .
what makes the mouse that ?
you know , nothing else , again , and <unk> .
and again , and again , `` daily <unk> that <unk> you know , and they 're soft .
that 's beautiful <unk> here with hay , so they do ? yes , there <unk> and it again , gone .
and that we 're not funny that probably has the mouse , once <unk> , yeah ?
or something needs to go , <unk> <unk> .
i was a few years , as i <unk> was a seminar home .
and once , so the street under and then i felt it was a black room , in and somehow got that i stand .
the next day i went to physician , because i thought , which is there go ?
he <unk> me and said , 's physically all right .
but it looks like this is <unk> ?
and i <unk> in my calendar date to check out , i worked three weeks , and somehow <unk> also the job .
so , years in the <unk> the participants across the first in the early on wondering whether we look at night i finally can do .
i also thought , there 's actually else for jobs ?
and i started <unk> to other priorities , and to do n't have time with my family <unk> and he something good for me to do .
<unk> and it 's not <unk> other <unk> there in my job as a new <unk> .
i got to the <unk> years of groups to be true pleasure .
i do is looking at 15 counseling and <unk> and other things -- <unk> <unk> give up to get rid of exchange , and whatever true pleasure .
and that was n't always .
i got to recognize humans , <unk> stress sick .
and sometimes need to make these <unk> of <unk> so , <unk> of me is the back from the hospital , and after a heart a bright and once in he also look at <unk> .
earlier than i said , you with <unk> it 's me <unk> , you 're going to the way .
today 's how about ourselves .
it was in <unk> a beautiful slow , right <unk> , but eventually , and also able <unk> go .
what happens ?
if you get healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve . <unk> of the because <unk> health .
<unk> minus four percent of the <unk> last 10 years , <unk> , minus <unk> percent , that 's beautiful , that will less .
<unk> the <unk> of plus <unk> percent .
that 's where i think about that would be ?
so why ?
but only in <unk> ?
no longer in germany , .
<unk> , <unk> , that will be healthier .
this is so here on the left to recognize .
and the mental of almost a hundred percent of the last 10 years to find a big german <unk> out .
of <unk> <unk> take advantage .
and the cost .
and i think about all kinds official , what can we do with this topic ?
it 's <unk> sometimes , and it <unk> <unk> for example here .
so we 're talking about .
and somebody once said , no alcohol , no solution .
but what is a solution ?
what we 're going to be healthy , <unk> and with pleasure to ?
and that the past was busy .
i got about it 's something like <unk> it 's something like to be ?
i 'm <unk> , the job is not that <unk> <unk> be happy to do .
are many other things , and the health , and so forth .
but in a lot of the part <unk> in the time .
and if we do that , why do n't do it 's us pleasure that 's the other .
the <unk> <unk> `` i <unk> in the last thing to the <unk> and <unk> .
these little <unk> , and hopefully then , <unk> .
<unk> is a talent <unk> the freedom and environment .
that means that , <unk> i mean talents ?
in the environment , `` i 'm starting with whom ?
and freedom , `` i 'm going to do , and what ?
it 's the degree of <unk> us <unk> .
ever more of the stress .
and what do n't it ?
the <unk> .
there are these four areas .
and it can see themselves to check .
i had gone for me to check a few years and i do that <unk> again .
i mean talents to ?
in the environment ?
and that means that go back in a <unk> with my laptop a seminar prepare a <unk> .
the freedom .
what we can i assume that , to tell you .
and do n't have been removed ?
the <unk> .
last u ''
and then there 's go there are me explain why do about .
and why do them much .
then i mostly in the answer is .
who want to find ways .
who do n't have reasons .
and <unk> and i can <unk> <unk> these different ways a `` i find some whistled in the reasons ?
and they in both right .
what do we do with our talent ?
every single one big <unk> <unk> .
this is a small .
it 's filled with talent for gold , with all kinds of their skills .
what do it ?
<unk> , <unk> ask this .
or if we in the other end of life .
what i with my talent ?

so , what do with our talent , which is so my first question , also asking ourselves , every day .
<unk> as a good enough ?
and resources .
there was but still with a story .
and i wanted to <unk> .
and that <unk> i am i 'm still do .
this <unk> was the salvation of <unk> years ago <unk> <unk> ten commandments , came up .
and the enemies <unk> that this <unk> so well , when i ca n't of .
thick walls <unk> ways of the <unk> to <unk> layers thick doors . <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
so <unk> time .
so we realized that , okay if we do , <unk> , then we have <unk> .
so let 's no more out and it .
's how long as well , <unk> .
the <unk> it from long until one day , where the <unk> almost <unk> .
they had just a <unk> it was already the way <unk> to be than the <unk> once , <unk> says , <unk> give me , <unk> and give me three days .
<unk> okay , <unk> , you have you <unk> , i <unk> 're talking to come to take off the <unk> and <unk> us .
<unk> 's how to <unk> away .
once the bottom line , how about the wall street <unk> a <unk> <unk> being led to go left , and already in the early .
well , we realized that <unk> what is that .
it 's <unk> .
it 's <unk> <unk> the top of the wall street <unk> time he is that black .
enemies think , `` oh , which has two <unk> , it can be something to .
at night the scenario , and every time is he knows that <unk> , there and led .
the second day after the six different <unk> have seen , and you in a <unk> off .
because they thought that takes us . we 're going to do n't .
then went to <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
in fact , and they had , and they <unk> .
they are the <unk> <unk> from .
i like this idea and there 's what we need to understand everything .
sometimes it <unk> , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's stage .
but also so we can you do something .
we have no idea of the power , we have the world , the .
and if you believe that could have a good <unk> and then right .
in <unk> the spring .
the coming .

there are <unk> eventually , from this <unk> the .
there are <unk> the popular ones that we harvest baby food .
there 's grain of corn and then <unk> fresh bread <unk> .
so there any animals to eat .
so there 's a lot of the products of course of food .
and it automatically .
it -- but think about that that maybe do n't automatically is all the 's a fear <unk> .
and this threat very short <unk> and also very <unk> but just in a <unk> , the connection that flower to get the bees today , very big role .

the sounds like <unk> , because it 's normal for us and we 're bees and that perceive .
there was now , some time a very interesting movie <unk> the subject .
and i <unk> you look , it .
now , but <unk> , we decided to mr. <unk> , which is the bees who live in his school , in <unk> the importance of bees in power .
that makes it 's a school , <unk> and he will now some of work .
please . <unk> .
yes , good evening .
the time , thank you mr. <unk> and all that <unk> .
and here with my project <unk> <unk> <unk> something to you 're looking at the bees .
and also under the world <unk> something about this <unk> to tell that makes fun .

i do n't have no .
but maybe <unk> i 'm going to get that they are <unk> i love or to empathy , where to create and they 're <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> insect diversity <unk> .
my name is thomas <unk> , <unk> a young , with a wonderful woman married my father five children ready for <unk> and different <unk> and <unk> the dirty work for <unk> years in the <unk> with <unk> i looked like adults .
not a member of <unk> <unk> and in <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> with our oldest students in <unk> .
we work on the garden , in agriculture and in the <unk> .
<unk> is actually <unk> of <unk> <unk> this is <unk> <unk> .
this flying , is more than <unk> , a silence , a quiet .
and they lead to be quiet .
it 's almost a <unk> .
and not free already the greeks have between honey , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and in a wonderful <unk> of homer describes himself like the <unk> <unk> his <unk> the <unk> poet , to see him to inspire him with dense .
but the <unk> go to do n't know ourselves , but they send in the bees and <unk> now the poet at the lips , <unk> and <unk> in the mouth straight and again , with him later , the words , honey from the <unk> that .
a beautiful picture .
hopefully <unk> me tonight .
yeah .
this flying classrooms .
i come to project .
these <unk> this <unk> , just now my students with me , built it comes for 30 percent <unk> days in a <unk> .
in <unk> schools of us in <unk> into <unk> or in the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> , <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> or in <unk> us in <unk> .
the teacher attitudes toward this project accompanied that with me into the class and we look at <unk> place for a <unk> .
mostly the window on the children can see during these <unk> .
and all things that the bees and then in there are through the <unk> out and again <unk> .
there will then the window , <unk> .
this .
and she starts all that , on the <unk> .
i guess what are <unk> and <unk> be gone from a <unk> <unk> two <unk> out and <unk> now here in these <unk> straight line .
this planet , on this <unk> are <unk> the bees .
it 's a <unk> <unk> , and here to the edge of fresh <unk> to be so fresh eggs .
and then i also a <unk> ended up here .
there 's the honey , .
we need to be bad weather is n't fly .
this .
what we .
then the <unk> here again on and it starts to transport , for <unk> places , which is <unk> place in school .
and now , something wonderful .
and gentlemen , the these bees there , and then in the class is a sudden , .
and people 's not .
they are <unk> .
they find your queen .
and that 's important task from <unk> you like this <unk> <unk> that he on <unk> in fact , in the up .
they 're on these two <unk> person .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they 're going <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , they <unk> .
you hear that .
they <unk> almost a <unk> higher than when they normally brain . <unk> with a queen together .
and now begins with <unk> .
and gentlemen , the end up in one night , so we need to a new , the reasons , and all that happened without <unk> , <unk> through conferences , without discussions , opinions and <unk> .
so people who <unk> and , then in the first night , as a <unk> .
because the queen of this , after six weeks n't exist .
because <unk> the only six weeks for .
this .
and in the first night , you from a lot <unk> a pen and egg , and that in this <unk> straight line .
and there <unk> and then <unk> queen .
every one of them <unk> in the high school , says , how do n't go ?
yes , genetically <unk> it 's all genetically <unk> .
true .
and now , something wonderful .


there 's <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
you know that term .
and immediately is on this <unk> on <unk> imagine the genetic code .
the <unk> go through the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> changed .
we had seen earlier , which we need to eat , and he walks us .
and the queen 's really wonderful to experience .

and that designers acting student all <unk> .
that you see in class .
and then this cell <unk> with a <unk> <unk> and all that happens then , because people now <unk> to <unk> , because of <unk> says , this is it be able to <unk> a <unk> says , that now .
no , that happens <unk> .
and gentlemen , the , that 's a <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
and then we need to eight days in my student knows , five years ago , and so <unk> days that these queen <unk> .
and the day , if we 're going to the teacher that , <unk> in the <unk> there <unk> the <unk> in the students in order to five o'clock , yeah .
and she says the mother to tell me , what 's because there go ?
yes , i held high school .
yes , because that ?

and then we are the morning after six school .
and then on to their dignity <unk> <unk> this <unk> they 're <unk> want to the queen , <unk> .
and if you really experience can listen to something .
the queen <unk> .
this .
still a bit higher .
and then the <unk> and cut the queen free .
that the first of the queen , they <unk> their wing , and that are now with their <unk> this , what about ourselves a queen <unk> has their <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
`` right now , identity .
now , three to five for the queen <unk> .
the <unk> forward <unk> you <unk> <unk> .
back the <unk> out of the people come from this <unk> .
and after five days and the queen <unk> from the <unk> out .
i think now , `` i 've seen this is a <unk> in <unk> .

what different .
-- let them .
the queen , and let alone , <unk> , without <unk> , from this <unk> out , and two miles .
they certainly , seen in your <unk> .
in the <unk> and there in a <unk> <unk> now <unk> kind of seven or twelve drones , the male bees .
so , like that islam , looking for women have about here 's the queen of those seven or twelve men .
and all that happens in a wonderful way in <unk> .
the drone comes from <unk> the queen the queen , now in this <unk> <unk> all that they have grown five years ago for the eggs the .
for the drone is it 's amazing experience .
when they finished work with the <unk> dies , and the dead from .
and then the queen going back and starts 100 eggs the .
it 's always two students in the class , immediately see .
we can also need the queen .
yeah .
and then the end slowly in school because now , <unk> again <unk> and the queen , and <unk> going to act closely in there .
and then come up and then you to this <unk> .
<unk> like that <unk> outside of the next morning <unk> like this <unk> with the queen of these bees to me on the <unk> .
and there you 're still the queen .
yeah .
the <unk> .
and <unk> , 10 or twelve <unk> .
and then , yes , these two <unk> come up here in a <unk> .
so , stick with , a <unk> and now can bring people 's <unk> .
why we school ?
and gentlemen , the kids who has experienced that we forget that never left .
yeah .
there 's not just like , in this class , and students all the time with the bees , are not all the school saying yes , and it .
and the teacher , if he knows is something that is when he would be prepared me to be an era of the other <unk> .
look at the bees and <unk> <unk> years <unk> years , we <unk> , where the people around the honey <unk> .
a few months , you in israel <unk> . <unk> found in the people at the bees that have .
any human culture has the bees <unk> .
or , and the bees were in every culture .
in china , in india in <unk> , in egypt , in <unk> in rome .

and within cultures and gentlemen , the last 30 years .
he can a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , he can a <unk> <unk> .
and gentlemen , the you know the flowers , or the bees <unk> , what they need ?
it out there 's something that i was in agriculture .
turns out there is that 's a green desert for our bees .

he can a math -- a <unk> <unk> .
yes , and gentlemen , the way , he with the students in the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> .
and then she wants to the question , how could karl , fresh <unk> the nobel why ?
because he had begun to the bees can see in the <unk> .
but , and gentlemen , the end up in a <unk> it 's <unk> .
there are also a bee .
and just a professor <unk> , many years ago , <unk> the university taught me the united states <unk> <unk> that the bees on a <unk> create a single <unk> .
as a <unk> web , <unk> on the <unk> a <unk> , and now , <unk> <unk> their <unk> there <unk> , and the bees flying <unk> , and it with their legs up with their <unk> .
you see , what these bees school ?
it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the kids lose their fear of bees .
and develop new awareness for the bees .
they learn <unk> , <unk> , what the bees do .
and they get a warning of these creatures . basically just for us save lives .
the bees do <unk> n't a million people year .
and <unk> in the only way , their candles .
they have <unk> out of trees that <unk> .
that 's a <unk> , <unk> , people .
and now imagine if i was , that <unk> -- and <unk> bees on the <unk> space . <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's <unk> without end .

because they 're <unk> natural antibiotics .
they 're just the fact that they <unk> it 's the <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .

and there is a grid , and with <unk> with a <unk> so there 's nothing .
yes , and then and gentlemen , the same <unk> the <unk> do that the bees course , and we have less <unk> when the bees do n't fly , or we 'd like the chinese , on the <unk> <unk> and they themselves <unk> .
there 's much more <unk> .

and there and the bee , <unk> of their <unk> and <unk> these <unk> .

our own <unk> , <unk> turned out of education <unk> .
in schools in universities , a chinese taught .
and our religion and we can free <unk> .
the <unk> lose that their culture and identity .
and if someone <unk> is the right ? <unk> the risk for <unk> torture or death .
that was also why my parents , i decided to us kids <unk> .
that was <unk> and i was at 11 years old .
picture is just to escape from .
we did n't enough money i had my father , i do .
i <unk> visual at a lot of the escape helped .
i <unk> visual at many pictures .
i <unk> me , but first time <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> to him exactly , because my eyes <unk> .
he was big had <unk> <unk> now , and we met him alive with little <unk> on a .
the first rate was to
i know that many of <unk> image of <unk> have that the only do n't want to refugees exploit to do n't know for the <unk> care .
but i <unk> to say , <unk> to him as <unk> to do <unk> .
because <unk> has <unk> accompanied him .
he stood up with airport in <unk> on a <unk> has to our last end <unk> we also really sure that <unk> came up .
airport in <unk> , there , and i 'm going to my mother , they said , just out of the airport .

and there are .
because i had , in my hand , <unk> and there was also my photo , but there was a <unk> name of <unk> .
i had a <unk> through the <unk> .
and i <unk> `` i <unk> <unk> , <unk> he had <unk> in the hand .

i spent my whole , in <unk> .
that was for my mother 's easy .
alone with us , without a man , in the uncertainty , we 're just a <unk> and in any <unk> .
i <unk> `` i ca n't have very , aggressive sounds of the time .
it 's me that 's embarrassing , that now , everything to tell you need to my story .
i was too aggressive and could tell you were somehow that .
and brought us first time <unk> <unk> where we first time with a of touch came up .
the normal , `` i got to do n't <unk> , had .
i <unk> 're also the <unk> with my brother and <unk> or <unk> sent it .
so this little <unk> .
i <unk> 're interested in several <unk> <unk> have done homework done in our parents , <unk> .
or have with us has painted .
we 've been a very <unk> .
i know , as we always say <unk> were working on <unk> until these people came out , i took about strangers , so good time , and that was such an important .
two years , and finally , in germany .
the problem , but he 's directly from <unk> , <unk> <unk> , because it in <unk> . no place , for him .
i <unk> and she said , very <unk> <unk> going to have my father of <unk> to a while they made it that he taught us in <unk> live <unk> .
i <unk> visual at this time where i really then , very happy , because after six years <unk> were that in a normal apartment , .
we 've got a <unk> for three years and we had finally own apartment , and <unk> of your kitchen .
and i had even room .
it was a very small and i had no desk , but it right , i was my door <unk> .
and i <unk> to me that time it , very good for myself , but i had yet , <unk> without a <unk> left .
i saw me no perspective .
there was a <unk> , in <unk> still be supported it 's still doing up with that the second <unk> my <unk> <unk> .
first <unk> the <unk> .
and the teachers , i thought i do the made it even from middle <unk> .
after i 'd <unk> .
and before i <unk> , and he said , with my best friend <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> an organization or a project , organized <unk> .
but i was n't <unk> that , `` i just done because we 're <unk> a place , where we just go .
we had <unk> , what we <unk> <unk> .
and the amount of <unk> helped us kind of our problems , you could and he <unk> us a us all this kind <unk> .
and after i 'd <unk> , <unk> .
and that 's a project , where young people without a <unk> to get an artistic <unk> .
that has been really very well , and i got to art is something about a little <unk> .
and <unk> to stay <unk> a filmmaker , .
he made the movie <unk> it 's my friends and me .
and the film won lots in .
we <unk> they were looking for our history <unk> .
he was a special feeling , it never experienced in that people in this .
and that was a moment where i thought , okay .
i want to <unk> .
i want something from my life .
a <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees in a mission was to go to a <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
but there was in the <unk> for me totally <unk> had ended birthday , <unk> for a <unk> and the title is <unk> one of the four .
so i was exactly right .
i played with .
and that great , after a <unk> two <unk> from <unk> <unk> me <unk> .
and i asked , i was n't just your own <unk> .
and then i , and <unk> .
now , `` i .
and i made for <unk> <unk> right now <unk> <unk> and of contributions of <unk> <unk> in . i also ourselves <unk> was for the european <unk> nominated me .
and i do it 's actually won .
i study of the <unk> for <unk> the movie <unk> <unk> in the third year and i <unk> the <unk> .
and it 's not possible , if not one or organizations like <unk> their projects like <unk> well , i used .
they have to me <unk> they have these spaces , they have to find that , is my place in society . <unk> .
and so , i 'm going to you .
every single , people like me to help second chance to get lives or their place in society to find .
because of those people <unk> come <unk> of refugees in <unk> one of them are full and every single a huge potential .
they have it with this determination to many <unk> <unk> behind them .
and with this determination to really big the for germany , and for every one too .
and i could actually , things you about what you can do , but i do n't enough time , though there 's a minute <unk> about them <unk> brought
<unk> , your phone , you can do n't tell you 're no code <unk> .
scan the code , and then come on the side of <unk> with <unk> you 're <unk> can do .
and that would be very good .
i <unk> now , for their engagement and we see us out of .
and scan the code .
i <unk> and it .
. how the phone , in the hand .
you 're <unk> , whatever ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> yeah .
i just a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> me that we stay .
my name is robin .
my <unk> is a lot easier than it talks .
i come in the <unk> , that 's in vienna .
i <unk> , and yet , the <unk> be able to be really beautiful here .
i <unk> and every time very good .
and that 's not <unk> , that 's a sense .
yeah to the other <unk> i 'm not here today , when you know anything to <unk> .
i <unk> n't want .
but it 's so that i texts write a , and then you might be paying mostly in <unk> <unk> or <unk> or just <unk> like today .
yes , and i was also been asked , here from texts <unk> of all that program a little <unk> .
and indeed <unk> `` i 'm doing .
yeah .
i start with a joke .
're looking at the chickens .
says , so , are two english chickens . <unk> called the <unk> not <unk> , but <unk> , very funny . <unk> called the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
says , yeah .
hey <unk> ca n't <unk> me .
here we know , are .
the first text is a little <unk> i had written . '' .
i got to make it 's a lot of looking at what does .
it `` the <unk> .
and yes , it was to understand .
as your head in my lap , slept . rest of my ceiling .
my leg was also under my ceiling your leg and outside the ceiling .
my leg and went through the ceiling .
it 's about her head , wait on my lap <unk> , the rest of them under the ceiling , my leg , under the ceiling with her leg of the ceiling .
that has <unk> talking about my leg extremely long .
it was very <unk> .
the text . and it 's a lot of a lot of .
and my grandpa did .
we have since no contact .
my <unk> grandfather was teaching profession , .
well as he 'd love <unk> <unk> .
is exactly alike .
yes , <unk> text .
get out .
jesus is the only <unk> is on the <unk> the glass of <unk> .
but where the jesus as he said , <unk> <unk> to save now ?
there to think ?
i 'm <unk> been brought ?
<unk> text .
the next a little bit longer .
he takes , and hours .
so anyway .
that gets faster .
so the beginning of novel , degrees in the <unk> write these .
ah , it 's <unk> guy that i , this guy is an improved over the hair <unk> and a little too <unk> .
i <unk> , but again this aware of <unk> i <unk> .
because i <unk> `` i never had hair <unk> .
chapter one .
if i <unk> is my head empty .
so empty the sheet that now , trying .
yes , and i 'm not come .
very hard and hours .
the next text is also a little <unk> .
most people understand not .
i do i enjoyed themselves too hard .
and it comes from the game just like the vocabulary of my language .
i 've just always been like i played .
and yeah , you come , things like out .
it `` the <unk> .
little bit strange yet <unk> .
so <unk> that <unk> <unk> , that ever had i did .
<unk> we can .
yes <unk> .
we all can .
we <unk> .
but i ca n't .
but i can 's .
i can <unk> .
i <unk> n't .
yes , i 've been ourselves to understand .
no idea .
yeah <unk> of me .
i say `` always either , or no .
next sheet also has happened with text that .
's kind of a little <unk> .
i got to look at the insects .
very <unk> .
yes , <unk> text .
is a little <unk> .
and about it 's when i do that her three , <unk> .
and text , `` the way , all good things are cool .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> so dry .
<unk> we <unk> <unk> .
so <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and then all that , and yes .
a <unk> moment .
yes , <unk> <unk> , that 's time thing .
and about it 's when i do is that we all the <unk> kind <unk> you might be <unk> try us .
he does n't know what the wind power wait .
you , `` the <unk> and this .
yeah .
fun , you .
the <unk> text and it just a sentence .
i write these things like this <unk> .
this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ? <unk> s .
<unk> s ?
yeah .
fun , you .
yes , <unk> sentence .
it 's in <unk> .
is a very long sentence .
i find it <unk> impossible to <unk> in <unk> to explain that 's the point .
here , a text .
this one day is a <unk> .
the title of text .
this one day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he has been <unk> before i 'd like <unk> .
he was <unk> seen briefly <unk> as well , and he <unk> .
i can even sooner still in the <unk> .
i did something pure joy .
it as <unk> interested in a few <unk> and , and the .
with a <unk> <unk> the face where else ?
and , it 's going to by <unk> .
and i should not going back up it can do n't know , <unk> i traded .
there hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
what , and albert einstein had to be <unk> not <unk> ?
i <unk> .
this .
letter <unk> sounds like the cow .
so this funny .
yes , the text also has a paper <unk> learned .
is more what <unk> .
so , i write it 's funny things .
i write it also partially of the stuff .
and it <unk> 're often ask where i <unk> me .
and , yes , there , `` i just a text message .
he `` the <unk> .
my father came from vienna , then in my mother and i saw her .
yeah .
we 're <unk> .
you for letting sound .
yes , this <unk> just like a little advertising .
i can do n't <unk> to afford , so i have to the <unk> .
and it <unk> `` i also ourselves <unk> and i <unk> also ourselves , <unk> <unk> in vienna .
can you 'll come .
and yes , i <unk> and he was <unk> 're actually very <unk> .
and , yeah .
i want me , i said .
it on the program .
in advertising .
that 's a little in the time that i did .
feet .
rich people vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin <unk> .
, very funny .
i want to a joke about <unk> your friend , but the <unk> was just a flat .
it 's not <unk> my <unk> .
<unk> called <unk> to stop the <unk> <unk> <unk> called <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of it .
yeah .
you for about listening .
you were great .
you , and gentlemen , the .
so this with a <unk> to begin .
why do you <unk> why do ?
and i , <unk> <unk> should be wondering whether he <unk> be potentially society , <unk> .
and the way .
we know now , we look at birth to talk about <unk> about genetically <unk> .
that is it any <unk> , <unk> give the impact on <unk> .
why we know yet , so ?
why we going <unk> of <unk> news from the <unk> , of each disagree ?
you remember all of <unk> almost seemed to <unk> .
it was fat .
you thought , and if you fat from the food <unk> if we all <unk> to be healthy old .
what 's <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves at different <unk> in american <unk> led me and what would have changed in fact that the americans every year thicker , are .
then , you said , ah , no .
but not enough fat .
there are the <unk> .
then what to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> , and led me .
it so again <unk> new <unk> <unk> through the village <unk> .
where all the <unk> ?
well , the reason is that taste of the way through <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the wisdom <unk> .

and <unk> know you all .
<unk> published a much <unk> magazine , <unk> .
the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for <unk> year .
keith richards , seven years is one nominated me .
he died in the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest man , the <unk> the earth lived .
<unk> years old .
i know there somewhere , what they are <unk> , but in their <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> .
and they stopped with <unk> on the smoking , but with <unk> again , and then finally , <unk> <unk> the path by virtue , to follow me stop them smoking .
and <unk> is it died .
what us that ?
i do cigarettes healthy .
but it tells us , very complicated , and clean statistics , we need the experimental systems and we need to ask .
<unk> very simple question is a simple <unk> , in different countries <unk> is women get older than men .
what is that ?
we now .
so on testosterone up with <unk> , in the male <unk> produced .
and it 's <unk> very simple evidence for <unk> men in the old , women .
can now everybody else to think i do this a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a <unk> country .
but it 's better <unk> , no fear .
generally , we 're in correlation of <unk> to <unk> .
sounds complicated , but at the <unk> illustrate .
there to find somebody <unk> <unk> , and they 're going to be done it 's a very old , right ?
ah .
and grandma , every day , cigarettes <unk> .
that 's probably the secret of age right ?
we have the ten cigarettes , just not <unk> .
or they <unk> and grandma , without the cigarettes , get .
so hard statistics are not always <unk> .
there , for <unk> very hard statistics , which shows that people <unk> in the <unk> visit older than people do n't do .
<unk> .
so <unk> .
so that 's <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it is -- just enough money back pocket of the good for her age and the <unk> the of
if i was a group of <unk> a <unk> to forage give and they do , percent longer lives as <unk> <unk> the <unk> just ca n't get dengue , but otherwise , exactly explain this was then i actually probably a <unk> factor in the diet affected .
and actually going to try been .
tell you 've got <unk> 's very <unk> what , i do with my , <unk> i 'm <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
and that works for the <unk> organisms .
for example of bacteria .
what you <unk> <unk> of bacteria .
if we <unk> , in <unk> line and then i became clear .
the same is <unk> , <unk> the mice and recently was just about two years , that it even monkeys is .
and here is a skinny .
it works , <unk> the <unk> kitchen .
and that 's another experiment , what the united states right .
what you ?

and who <unk> out of our mice , dick , too sick and we <unk> clearly bad <unk> had a bad <unk> .
now , you <unk> <unk> <unk> the mines has exactly the same number of <unk> <unk> just <unk> <unk> break .
we have <unk> nothing you ca n't have looked at twice as a .
and this <unk> now <unk> and healthy and they also has no <unk> .
although , mice <unk> <unk> .
both have equal than a .
the sick and the other healthy .
so what i mean ?
it is a process called <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
when in a living cells -- take it starts with an organism , and <unk> <unk> in the cell or <unk> <unk> <unk> to make their energy .
that makes sense .
and that looks .
you can see how to the cell <unk> , <unk> , mainly from the <unk> , during the age <unk> .
the <unk> then with the <unk> the <unk> be <unk> and the cell as energy back to .
it 's just <unk> the age <unk> the boundaries of the
that 's . that molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> from the <unk> to report .
so , it ? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in <unk> organisms .
and it 's probably going to that that , people work .
and we learn that they 're just not like in <unk> <unk> every little <unk> the day with , <unk> fight .
no .
but they will try to tell you 're hungry , ah , maybe the <unk> <unk> .
to sell their hunger is a friend .
and that makes it <unk> sense .
while <unk> <unk> , nine percent of history has , what did n't really hungry for ?
he 's for .
we regularly , refrigerator for the hunger .
and that 's safe , biology .
now we know , and that 's already in the bible , in <unk> chapter <unk> <unk> <unk> , the mind is <unk> of meat is weak .
that <unk> looks very different .
here , <unk> <unk> in a medieval <unk> shown .
the three <unk> here . right , we 're going to let 's also <unk> .
and that 's a very real <unk> .
we 've been so on the quest <unk> the molecular and the <unk> <unk> although an organism eats .
that could be more interesting to be their <unk> not enough just <unk> <unk> <unk> .

so the question is so <unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> . eats ?
and we have many hundreds of a thousand <unk> <unk> the natural <unk> .
we have in a found that means <unk> .
<unk> 's a <unk> , there 's organisms <unk> <unk> , but also in many organisms . <unk> less .
in the skin is it 's <unk> .
<unk> people have already in less <unk> in the skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> the human cells , for example , then you see here .
that 's <unk> <unk> cell .
so this <unk> , the <unk> we give <unk> on and we have to this little <unk> in the cell , the <unk> , during the age <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells that 's exactly .
and that works in <unk> organisms .
here 's shown in <unk> .
so we have <unk> <unk> found the molecular <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
a fusion a little bit longer .
and the answer is again , what you <unk> typical <unk> of a <unk> .
there are simple <unk> .
and <unk> days are all dead , <unk> days is about the dead .
whenever i 've <unk> the water from here in <unk> of the older and survive better .
we also human cells in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reached western culture years ago , so long , if you with <unk> put them .
the latest research put too close that it 's over mice , <unk> <unk> .
it 's not only life , it 's also <unk> .
these mice are clearly <unk> .
so .
now you can all know , where <unk> ?
how the name it says , it 's the sperm 've been , because it 's very high <unk> .
but i can you <unk> we also in <unk> <unk> green <unk> <unk> cheese , and a product from <unk> <unk> we 're in japan , <unk> <unk> , that 's so <unk> <unk> a lot <unk> .
we 've been interested in the <unk> against <unk> helps to the <unk> <unk> helps people might also the computer <unk> ?
they 're going on the common <unk> of all <unk> the area decreases during the age <unk> the brain <unk> .
and we have of experiments led .
they <unk> , we have the flies .
flies by which is <unk> they 're old .
they have more <unk> and they 're old .
and the <unk> mechanisms for memory <unk> these are similar to people .
now ? yet , like the devil has guy moving memory of flies measured ?
this experiment we 're able to stephen <unk> approved , berlin done .
you take the flies and <unk> going to give them , <unk> , and they love .
<unk> .
and let people in this <unk> <unk> .
then you the same , when in the next and try to give them <unk> other <unk> , and they love , which <unk> .
so let 's <unk> enjoy poetry , but <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
then , the same fly right here in .
and drive a degree in the <unk> down , because you see .
and if you down here , and when of the <unk> and other side <unk> .
where the right ?
.
and <unk> .
except the two here .
are the <unk> .
or say , character .
i love my <unk> and i let me get through the <unk> <unk> reward <unk> .
okay .
it <unk> form of <unk> , there , <unk> .
not just to fly .
and the <unk> to fly through <unk> , <unk> on a <unk> as well , again .
and the <unk> the brain that they were back <unk> .
that means <unk> does n't just the computer <unk> it against <unk> of you might be .
and that 's important , because we want to the <unk> not the <unk> , se <unk> .
it makes sense of the time <unk> to <unk> .
and i mean , and i 'm a few practical <unk> to give you know , younger .
the time <unk> <unk> .
it 's not about the weight of the way .
there 's actually come in <unk> <unk> group of <unk> of day , and day , eats .
so that 's <unk> <unk> under the line of <unk> <unk> by erwin <unk> .
and keep a very well .
that means it 's <unk> .
avoid collapse <unk> .
it 's not <unk> complex <unk> seem . dangerous .
it 's really sweets .
you know now , <unk> <unk> and diabetes <unk> , even then when they <unk> are .
and you know that sugar growth of tumors accelerate .
you 're <unk> <unk> centered on in the <unk> .
after 30 days are all dead .
in a <unk> of <unk> rich .
the <unk> effect on .
there 's just give it works in almost a way .
and they regularly <unk> and vegetables .
avoid the <unk> very much <unk> or <unk> it .
you know now , <unk> -- and <unk> cancer of .
that the microscope -- and vitamin d .
we might degrees in winter , <unk> , because vitamin d dominated by sunlight on the skin educated .
some at least three times per week <unk> half hour , that 's <unk> .
cigarettes -- <unk> <unk> examples of you <unk> 10 years <unk> years <unk> .
they 're in times the <unk> <unk> occasionally be quiet .

and monks in the long as many women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> in a lot of <unk> .
just <unk> die in the <unk> .
what is that ?
the people think about that has happened with , <unk> that .
, , that 's easy .
if you a <unk> the window and then <unk> '' which i 'd <unk> <unk> the way .
and what something happens is a more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> and so what , and alcohol -- -- there <unk> .
so , alcohol , <unk> <unk> effect .
it . partners , or <unk> family , <unk> <unk> .
they should not a lot <unk> to live .
now think that <unk> .
that has but with <unk> at that .
it 's <unk> .
you can measure the closer to a lot <unk> the lives depend on <unk> 's the blood .
and also , if he says , i got me <unk> 're used .
i can do n't sleep and the noise me anything .
not true .
and yet , <unk> the blood and that 's bad .

we know now , <unk> very good <unk> effects .
and so you 're <unk> to .
and we also know that <unk> and <unk> mice , <unk> protect .
i knew by our <unk> i gave us with <unk> , and <unk> .
. not a sense .
several of <unk> the dark chocolate , dementia <unk> do .
just recently is a nice people <unk> 've been shown in fact that <unk> a panel dark chocolate a day , <unk> one <unk> the level of <unk> .
something they 're having coffee and <unk> be thinner .
there is studies have to show some studies have n't show .
what you get it 's a coffee -- diabetes <unk> looks and so , <unk> performance better .
and coffee is also a good <unk> because he solves <unk> from ourselves with <unk> <unk> from paris show .
<unk> very beautiful and <unk> study in the <unk> people <unk> for our ideas have shown that people every day <unk> handful <unk> eat their <unk> to see , like to .
that 's a <unk> value for <unk> <unk> study .
and that is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
do , but for peanuts . <unk> 've actually <unk> are .
and the only by looking at <unk> call `` okay ?
now , but <unk> .
so the peanuts is n't that .
the next thing is a little <unk> .
avoid various types of a <unk> proteins , so much meat and <unk> , but they 're going <unk> and <unk> years old .
<unk> very beautiful new study that they 're in this <unk> much <unk> proteins that if you 're <unk> so increase , if you have a <unk> united states .
is not for the time , where <unk> proteins , and it , not <unk> kids get teenagers . <unk> proteins that 's not for <unk> and use it to be .
generally avoid collapse <unk> .
, they do n't stay alive <unk> i knew already <unk> <unk> i said , <unk> , the <unk> , that <unk> <unk> the <unk> are signs of health .
everything <unk> heard in the <unk> .
here is the <unk> <unk> talk about , regime lived and he 's <unk> years old .
he comes from my home <unk> from the <unk> 's been seen sick .
and the very good .

he has about the <unk> followed , i said .

which is <unk> the <unk> me <unk> a biological but <unk> to be , and finally , <unk> .
you <unk> the old people less , and that could one <unk> of our culture .
<unk> wrote the novel virus <unk> a year ago his death .
and brothers <unk> .
a piece , contemporary critics who stands for fresh <unk> .
you very much attention .
i start with a question , i think .
now , where now , up to this little bit <unk> because of you is <unk> ?
the <unk> is very low .
lower half as i thought .
it 's probably reasons why they have reported in the most people to keep us . <unk> .
many people <unk> <unk> and <unk> and think that would <unk> .
this is that at the case .
see <unk> 's actually a phenomenon , as alone .
maybe it 's also , they have reported in the question <unk> <unk> .
and you <unk> or is you <unk> ?
you can <unk> feel , without <unk> .
and you can <unk> be able to the moment <unk> feeling .
<unk> also has a shame that .
and that will have now here <unk> have to <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> leads to shame , shame , in <unk> .
<unk> takes time .
and it 's now here was reported in a few seconds , you gave them .
<unk> takes <unk> .
<unk> takes time , and even aware .
and <unk> requires exercise to talk about .
and this practice and we <unk> n't .
we have n't language , we have the ourselves to recognize when we are <unk> ?

a part of humanity , you 're beginning to put <unk> .
the birth to our death , you actually just <unk> .
there are few moments in life where you see that <unk> .
these people go into account behaviors <unk> a little about all day off .
i did `` no time , which is so you <unk> .
and then , maybe less <unk> to say , everything is to .
that there , i 've got this is part of the big universe .
and it 's the big group of the , i <unk> the time , it .
i think , okay , today i 'm <unk> and the next day , it 's all together .
if we 're <unk> think falls into the first of the big <unk> a pencil .
the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> on a in
but about this <unk> this big <unk> <unk> `` i ca n't talk , but i talk about the little bit about the mundane <unk> , where <unk> we also in the theater face .
i want to talk about , and <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> other to the world , not hard <unk> us to <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> has to break a few pictures made me show you want .
how easy to access to each other <unk> to .
you know what i do these people actually there <unk> felt .
but who knows , and the moment , <unk> an where you think all talk to show you do is something lost in the way to anyone who <unk> .
and suddenly <unk> <unk> know , here .
maybe some today i experienced .
what you can do something pulls his phone , very often hilarious , you today , this is that <unk> , that <unk> on the phone to escape . <unk> .
the visible when the display look .
what we do n't do .
yes , and then the <unk> the <unk> of course , and the <unk> one <unk> on <unk> on hundreds of <unk> <unk> , and you do n't rely on the hope you have a text , the .
are the <unk> the outside .
the other people <unk> .
but i 'm sure there 's the room , birth to put <unk> feel like , my entire world <unk> and she tried to these <unk> me <unk> to <unk> .
and it 's in this room <unk> also people <unk> they 're going to <unk> to say , because of death or a separation .
there , and that still so many people too many people are connected to , they feel <unk> .
and people have to himself to find no contact each other people who are so <unk> .
i <unk> in the digital <unk> .
and sit in her <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> 's very familiar .
are people are going to think it <unk> this is a .
it 's still a relatively .
it 's not <unk> number , no <unk> number , whenever somebody being human <unk> to do n't .
it falls out of the old people .
it 's the <unk> form of <unk> .
since we 're all <unk> live , the people on facebook or , twitter or facebook is this digital <unk> bigger .
you can be hundreds of people connected to be without any of people really connected .
it 's not <unk> <unk> rather than <unk> of human relations , which is it 's the digital <unk> quality of relationships .
the two forms of <unk> be very often <unk> <unk> .
so , in the <unk> <unk> a little <unk> <unk> .
whereas the digital <unk> a good <unk> for <unk> and <unk> in <unk> .
it 's one of <unk> that the digital <unk> the future . <unk> , if the opportunities to connect to get bigger .
i do n't whether you know , in this sense of the inside of <unk> like to one more <unk> call .
or whether you have a new term .
but that are also a sudden , <unk> generation .
almost more than the <unk> itself is the fear of <unk> and from that fear of <unk> are people , to be ready .
<unk> of the big <unk> , it 's <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
that describes how many people do everything , is not alone .
they <unk> many witnesses , and then <unk> who are alone .
but that <unk> terrified look after the fear of <unk> to <unk> , which we spend .
<unk> go .
and <unk> .
both the process <unk> in the <unk> it 's a <unk> into contact <unk> in the objects themselves . <unk> .
it 's just a very short -- and the kind of <unk> against <unk> .
so we go up to buy a new <unk> .
i got me , for a bit <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> , which is <unk> , at communication with the <unk> be <unk> of it .
what that 's <unk> to you , but apparently , and that .
<unk> so , with the <unk> to do <unk> find these people , instead .
<unk> <unk> has a wonderful poem written , and there is a <unk> but that 's the <unk> to <unk> .
hand on the heart disease who knows that ?
in a relationship <unk> , or the other , <unk> , and suddenly awful in order to feel awful <unk> feeling and the question to who 's this is really ?
you 're going to do something ?
a study says that the <unk> women who <unk> get married , with school .
<unk> , because i may have n't know whether , even invented and so often , `` i told me .
but is now , whatever it at the most matter , and the reaction , this is that the people , <unk> .
that the <unk> so , granted , is almost a <unk> .
<unk> to <unk> is that <unk> and yet 's not about you .
i just talk about the <unk> the sex .
and that has probably everybody .
yet . <unk> is a sudden , which is , `` here i mean ?
who is this person in my bed in
also a form of <unk> do n't do n't have to the quality of sexual <unk> .
come to do n't have to the quality .
it 's just always there .
we do n't do we 're going .
we 're right about the workforce .
the workforce is the <unk> also <unk> as we think .
i stood <unk> , <unk> <unk> and i do a group of five <unk> of this year carrying suit and two , <unk> .
the two men in the past two women in <unk> in the .
and between was something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> a lot of <unk> .
i <unk> , i have the scene begin to do with this is a <unk> , but also , in his workforce experienced , again <unk> .
it 's the world <unk> the <unk> .
it 's also the <unk> the <unk> .
we all the <unk> , i see , here , and some of your life <unk> , <unk> .
in <unk> work , <unk> into hotels , in <unk> <unk> are often do n't know , who actually what they do .
where you are going to pick up .
it 's a form of <unk> take care about .
and so it 's also <unk> , how <unk> as <unk> <unk> can be .
<unk> is here <unk> .
i spent time , <unk> told that he called was a <unk> , and the said , it 's what 's <unk> and what you ca n't do n't .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
so he himself , <unk> that .
and two months later he is also <unk> .
the <unk> coming . '' so .
it comes the connection with other feelings .
and beautiful siblings and <unk> siblings .
the <unk> siblings and we all .
the ultimate sadness , anger and the shame .
but most beautiful siblings not forget .
we 're proud of <unk> that <unk> .
so my <unk> take <unk> .
to go in life , <unk> a flood .
so , and let 's not her .
because there something much worse than <unk> and that 's the empty space may be <unk> comes when you do n't feel .
<unk> is part of life .
since i <unk> about <unk> thought i have for me two things .
the in my <unk> the <unk> i do n't like a <unk> the i realized i was only then when someone called `` why does n't <unk> because i thought , maybe <unk> the people , maybe <unk> `` i <unk> .
my since of course , since i <unk> in my life accepted the people and go .
that is it with the <unk> , etc .
and there are <unk> .
people come back to do n't immediately grasp <unk> whether it from a encounter a friendship , a <unk> to .
as i found my parents , embarrassing .
we can see , <unk> <unk> without having someone , start .
if you <unk> or in the economy .
every time led to <unk> <unk> .
as i found that , embarrassing .
as young adult . they 're going <unk> , and openness .
but since i 'm going to <unk> busy . <unk> me , and again , i <unk> dress up .
it 's <unk> that means that are willing to the next green .
you .
yes , you .
i got me mention three <unk> .
and <unk> a <unk> and <unk> .
and now <unk> and even if you only once <unk> <unk> what <unk> they would assume ?
most people pay for the <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we 're <unk> effort the effect of .
we can do we somehow .
there are now we <unk> with the effect , except , and decide that are strategies .
we decide for instance , <unk> and so many sports .
and <unk> but big effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we decide , for the <unk> .
it 's a diet .
also very big <unk> but still very big effort .
for me , and also not so valuable .
and i want to tell you with the <unk> effort in <unk> of .
if you know , and health , if you the theme of <unk> around .
and that 's called <unk> .
and that 's <unk> was in germany . no issue , is about . <unk> .
and then the of <unk> in germany has .
and i got me ask what was there 's go into the <unk> ?
why was so <unk> suddenly , ?
and then there <unk> and i 'm also <unk> .
because it was exactly six years <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> in germany .
and we , thicker ?
and i did n't <unk> .
<unk> comes <unk> in germany .
and that <unk> up .

and what 's then germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and how it means .
and we , thicker ?
well , then there , and one <unk> .
because it was yeah .
sports , thick .
and <unk> `` what i 'm going to tell you might be the thick .
because not true .
but one , we now they found .
i 'd flood of the new <unk> -- and <unk> n't try and that we <unk> and healthier .
what is it so then ?
the diet ?
and there 's <unk> a great study from the states .
but the problem with <unk> .
and they have in the <unk> <unk> introduced .
and she wanted to tell me look what happens to do ?
and they have seen the people who are still less fat , but the people , fewer calories , and yet still a thicker .
and paradox .
and so you have it <unk> called .
we can you 're going ?
there 's get your body as a <unk> .
are here , <unk> big <unk> .
and on the a <unk> , because we all the <unk> on to be here burned .
and here 's energy <unk> saving electricity .
if we now , more <unk> here you give our <unk> , and consume <unk> the energy in <unk> and it makes <unk> .
the human body does n't explain <unk> .
we can apply energy <unk> .
and it in the fat .
our <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
what happens when we see how we have heard of energy <unk> and yet <unk> , here , and then makes it just finally extend .
the <unk> has a <unk> .
here , all of human genome .
we have a mobile .
and this happened .
our grandparents are <unk> yet , miles . <unk> .
and we come today <unk> once , or two miles and that are the positive <unk> .
there 's study engineering report five thousand years <unk> feet .
i <unk> me tell you <unk> with my friend mike .
<unk> that degrees in the chair ?
mike , come with degrees ' time ?
mike 's americans .
he 's shy , he will do n't talk .
and he was at this study , which is now here .
he 's a typical <unk> <unk> designer jeans <unk> <unk> and he has a <unk> in the hand .
and mike , and again , and take a <unk> still did , thicker .
why ?
and mike a person .
and i did n't <unk> how much , mike , the day , who whistled well , a <unk> back into the pocket <unk> and the evening . again <unk> .
and there stood on a steps .
it was so far away . mike <unk> the morning , <unk> the car with the car in office there 's a bit of the evening again .
and he came to steps .
that mike , this day 10 minutes on his legs .
<unk> hours and <unk> minutes and mike , was mike .
conditions for the disease states alone .
and mike , and dick he 's too , because long on top of energy <unk> , but not <unk> it <unk> 's thicker the energy <unk> .
and i <unk> the energy to see here in his <unk> .
but it 's <unk> , there 's not there .
the <unk> 're going back <unk> blood .
and there 's an active and <unk> still a little wing , <unk> .
so the <unk> .
so when the energy <unk> the blood , then the doctors ' <unk> <unk> and high <unk> .
and this <unk> , the <unk> there is how <unk> it makes all of holes in <unk> .
and a lucky <unk> , because fat around and that <unk> now , about these little wounds and we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
and now <unk> heart right under pressure we need to track blood , <unk> <unk> <unk> pumps and we talk about <unk> .
and if this <unk> then on a <unk> true , then it 's the body <unk> .
and if that our hearts and then we call heart .
and if that in happens then we call a .
and also in germany dies every second time heart and a .
that means of dying every second , <unk> .
and mike 's not so sick , in sports of , he did n't move .
and if you <unk> n't know , then , you always wrong . .
for example , a diet .
i have degrees ' yesterday , your diet by amazon <unk> and there are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
and if each book , which is an inch thick carbon dioxide we would be here <unk> we have 30 feet high <unk> recent <unk> <unk> .
and i got the time for you all read .
and there , and this is really important , even more energy would be more food as they consume , thick .
and if you less energy it as they consume , skinny .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need to <unk> here ?
that just finally extend .
we need this huge loss <unk> i did n't help .
because why <unk> a diet of hundred percent ?
because it a diet , and no lifestyle .
what <unk> , you 're talking about three weeks , and here 's five weeks , and then finally , fight back in the normal life back . a lifestyle .
what we then , after five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
except <unk> and again , <unk> the confidence that we do n't done , what we 're <unk> .
so , and they 're going to everyone on diet , every new <unk> questions , you 're in their life appeared in their lifestyle we .
now , or no ?
and when i then <unk> .
and if no point it .
because when the bottom , <unk> , it 's pure <unk> .
there are the habits helps to decide whether we get a healthy .
it the bad habits , sick .
and it the good habits helps us healthy .
and mike in the mirror at it looks at the result of everyday <unk> .
and mike in the mirror , you see , there 's everyday habits .
and mike in the mirror , and honest , and then when he said , he <unk> .
because when he was bad habits , so good and then it just the disease <unk> .
and mike , in the direction that direction of the opposite direction , and then he was an entire life <unk> .
it takes place , just a good habits , so bad .
and a <unk> habits mike 's also a great example that the person , weird animal .
mike , if there 's a completely from his life <unk> by the way with the car on every <unk> uses , <unk> uses .
and night and he <unk> on the <unk> and to somehow <unk> again ] movement .
so it , in his <unk> on the <unk> there with the <unk> , `` yes , se , and paradox is it 's like so <unk> rat back on in the <unk> and he kind of the movement .
and my grandpa have exactly <unk> as you .
it was <unk> and i understand .
and i said , sports is for people do n't move .
and somehow he 's right .
why have to do n't <unk> be the <unk> what we stood on <unk> have ?
<unk> that we have today , <unk> , two hours sports or a day .
and about very much easier , again , to find where we 've lost .
in life .
and so <unk> i am today to a <unk> invite you .
you know , and the situation where you do n't really fast to the <unk> that in the first is not a free .
and you see how , in this <unk> us .
we want to the shortest i go .
we plan to the way that we <unk> ways .
we plan our entire life so , <unk> ways , but that leads us not there , where we <unk> .
but a direction .


and i 'm way of the end up and down and up and down , and all other .
but when i said , i 'm going <unk> me , but the time for me .
then <unk> me , but the movement , and there 's just run around .
and if of the <unk> comes from 30 minutes <unk> to tell me , <unk> .
<unk> steps .
that is about 10 minutes translated it .
and a <unk> <unk> steps in fact , every day <unk> steps more and then that they 're at the 12 grams fat , in your body <unk> .
that may be relatively little sound .
but as <unk> , when <unk> established secure , <unk> every year , this talk about four <unk> five pounds fat .
we in our bodies .
and you <unk> with degrees ' time i 'm going <unk> to him , <unk> .
the americans are like nuts , and so what this .
that 's a <unk> five pounds fat .
so <unk> ' worth four pounds .
just telling you 'll see what happens with these little <unk> .
and if that a lot of this <unk> , what you 're just happens when they really , and <unk> to start .
and this <unk> to bring in fact , every day in their life .
once , <unk> steps per day , who are running shoes <unk> all <unk> .

then next decade <unk> also <unk> .
and they also the stronger .
but what they make your health , on a sports .

because most important thing you do now , and lifestyle .
and i <unk> as an active , <unk> .

because i think about health has not to do we 're doing something that we have .
but health has to do we 're doing .
and so <unk> `` i just give for you .
you decide if you today , just heard the best .
and now you know exactly how it .
step .
thank you .
<unk> how it a leonardo da <unk> actually done on this incredible . <unk> way around the eyes to see ?
and so far . <unk> to do . his time that , <unk> , <unk> was ?
we could do today , ?
that , maybe what <unk> to do ?
and so how it , and <unk> for our future <unk> ?
we start , there was working with the question what we actually more innovation ?
.
this new research and development and <unk> <unk> the federal , `` the <unk> the federal aid .
so , right .
that is yes , great .
and we can be quite proud to be grateful for that we <unk> blood pressure , the ones that our <unk> the world around the way that it 's good things about .
that we 'll give an extraordinary engineer unique , we have .
but look at the future ?
the challenges , because there as above us ?
and who care because there 's the ecological and social challenges ?
so <unk> it seems like <unk> .
a kind <unk> .
so the economy care of ecological challenges , as a big effort , we wanted productivity and efficiency on .
and the world , you want to find a nonprofit organizations and the and <unk> , and then also , and so <unk> <unk> course , then <unk> term capitalist in the <unk> .
least <unk> to repair .
but who says , that we all that we 're separated at this ?
? because if we <unk> . <unk> social and cultural dimension , ?
and technological innovation , whatever cultural innovation are ?
if economic innovations , and social innovation are ?


because it was that ?
both sides , but what companies , right ?
and <unk> ?
? maybe <unk> .
now , we 're always a contradiction <unk> .
there 's been <unk> examples .
muhammad yunus , and <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh a lot <unk> of poverty . <unk> .
and interestingly , much more just in <unk> <unk> , what kind of <unk> <unk> .

the opportunity , and a lot of <unk> me conclude with somebody to do .
<unk> you can i think <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> young guy .
, trained as well , but also the ideal <unk> .
and yeah , so totally <unk> .
i like a totally like .
and if you can see , you think , really , <unk> , because we need to manage our future is n't .
yes , in the <unk> he then , i started with one of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that he also very good .
that it 's totally and there 's also very successful .
and anything , there is still held him .
so he , is there does not a kind of this ?
so this is <unk> and then there .
<unk> are all over <unk> .
and that it 's too .
and you also <unk> .
so the right there 's also <unk> it 's what i realized .
so that i personally , so , <unk> says he 's already happening .
and there 's in the middle , and t : <unk> we did n't .
so , on he was surprised to him , this is <unk> personally imagined .
my pants <unk> .
and as <unk> <unk> as he then there was imagined .
it 's great pleasure that 's a young people and there , his own experience <unk> .
and the two and then you <unk> .
and have always <unk> .
? because if we just a couple of this conversation about two different <unk> ?
now , mister <unk> , so i was that because again .
what 's exactly the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> company ?
i 'm not be understood .
yes , so , <unk> then we start , and the question what is <unk> <unk> company ?
so name says , yeah .
<unk> markets , <unk> products , <unk> clients <unk> structures that 's a <unk> .
and you can also quite closely <unk> to be able to the big that <unk> .
and the <unk> <unk> <unk> think that at least can also .
what 's because it 's <unk> ?
so , <unk> , <unk> , and so one is it <unk> n't it 's not the little <unk> , of
it 's something different .
it 's a completely different character .
because it has , nothing <unk> .
no <unk> customers , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
and it 's a <unk> a <unk> organization puts out of purpose , model for this to create a <unk> of course , but the <unk> , and then scale .
and you sure that course , so <unk> any other other <unk> might be different <unk> the other techniques .
yes , that 's not enough .
but what we 're really ?
so , i <unk> ' time , and then here , there <unk> you <unk> <unk> to earn money ?
so i got it 's a degree , that fits very good , so <unk> seminar found in berlin would you , i <unk> ?
that is <unk> .
how you your company in <unk> and the <unk> your whole <unk> , you .
oh no .
it <unk> ?
what <unk> , because if you 're looking at 30 -- <unk> money , you what 's because after your <unk> ?
so <unk> you 've got a career as <unk> <unk> or what ?
what happens with your engagement as you know ?
and so , the <unk> .
so the statistics about <unk> to do n't <unk> perspective , because seventy percent of <unk> a few years before , in a lot <unk> financial situation , so forth a great .
that 's still a result of a successful of and one good <unk> of
now this is a <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
and the basis of economic <unk> .
but it 's never the one of
yes , what 's a goal ?
one of ?
so i was a visual . '' but it 's a goal is no way the right .
and so , to have n't always <unk> measurably <unk> and be so forth .
and if i , there is why did . so , how can we 're going to do n't know what i look what ?
so that makes me not feeling .
so how i want to decide to take risks , i feel for me , so <unk> and <unk> .
yes , <unk> welcome to <unk> .
but i got me , maybe what you .
a thread .
so this is already <unk> , so almost as secret .
successful <unk> of the next generation <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , you today ?
<unk> <unk> `` i <unk> ?
so we say , and <unk> .
and <unk> crises and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so that <unk> .
i <unk> . i can all of leave .
okay .
yes , mister <unk> .
but there are now , just ask .
we can you all over the most important <unk> qualities , to ask yourself .
so we 're looking at the other through that i might better understand ?
so the first what i 'm here and what i want to do ?
yes , <unk> , there . <unk> what moves you 're talking about <unk> gets bigger than to ?
what <unk> you go in the world ?
what we can persuade you 're going to work ?
what you ready to give ?
what are your inner city , yes , <unk> <unk> ?
why is so important to give it ?
because that are also , <unk> <unk> .
and how we do ?
if you a ship to want to <unk> not the men are parts of a hot . <unk> and the lesson , you <unk> the <unk> , <unk> sea .
yes , well .
so then <unk> i told me the next questions .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
i mean ?
yes , <unk> now , you with your goal became time <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in detail , <unk> but i <unk> i 'll explain , if you <unk> we do n't you want to be able to the .
<unk> you 're actually the story with the pink like ?
and it 's degree angle .
not ?
<unk> .
so , <unk> time .
<unk> you wo n't , elephants .
okay ?
works like this ?
so no , elephants .
understand ?
no , elephants .
see you ?
so here , if so on focus on that we 're not want .
what is there 's not only way ?
there , <unk> ?
yes , <unk> `` you imagine what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the <unk> on the <unk> .
but <unk> , you <unk> .
this is what i just <unk> you <unk> but <unk> ?
i got to do this brought
<unk> , if you go into the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> smith .
who ?
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> what <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> the glass in the <unk> <unk> .
i did <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i did <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> lady smith .
oh but but <unk> <unk> called <unk> ?
<unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> from <unk> .
it 's <unk> a <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> you ?
and <unk> look like ?
so you have noticed ?
and something changed ?
okay .
okay and the flower .
okay .
so , you look , then let 's the bear the world .
and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> smith .
who ?
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> what <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> the glass in the <unk> <unk> .
i did <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i did <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> lady smith .
and <unk> , how 's telling ?
so , i know , i was quite shocked .
i was really shocked .
i first time , and i did it .
i thought it can now , probably not too .
and of shocked when i told me through the head the might be that i mean that go through the area over ?
through my life .
and so i think that makes a totally sense .
and there 's immediate <unk> prevent it , most of our perception and our <unk> first <unk> .
but what 's because i mean ?
what <unk> `` i was and what <unk> i mean ?
and so <unk> to realize that your perception <unk> somewhere <unk> to the <unk> more important <unk> quality .
well , yes , thank you get , next question .
and i have to my goal here ?
so , i find <unk> good question .
that <unk> me , which every time , and somehow not go forward .
yes , <unk> , because there 's <unk> good news for you .
that will a lighter and as you might have <unk> , you .
because if you can <unk> clear in your <unk> incentive and if you <unk> <unk> goal . <unk> , `` promise i 'm going on inside of alone together .
which automatically .

and then this famous <unk> , you go up under the shower , you .
and <unk> question <unk> , i think , `` well , who are you <unk> could who are you get advice you could take much more <unk> you look at home .
and you 've also a big <unk> .
the <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> di <unk> , and i knew that occurred in his <unk> , in florence .
for lunch , famous big table .
and totally different people .
so scientists <unk> , nigerian banker in <unk> engineers , and he <unk> very intense <unk> <unk> .
but not in our economic sense , where it <unk> , yes , who , through ?
who has right ?
but rather be a sudden , these different <unk> things that are the fact , no way that we alone have <unk> .
well , yes , the next question is what concrete next step up ?
<unk> to make it 's successful entrepreneur in the reason .
instead of business plan for a , and focus on forever , just on the next step .
because what you because of <unk> also do ?
but the lead to be determined by the consequence .
and if it 's nothing particularly well , and they wait <unk> one step .
and even if the big , <unk> <unk> <unk> nothing was then there 's wait <unk> .
so it 's important that you , what it is .
that you the security .
and in <unk> how did we have to happen ?
although we 'll tell you ca n't know , and nobody told me ?
<unk> you 're also <unk> the children .
so it , <unk> learn this , and this <unk> <unk> this is it also have fun makes them in a company happening in a <unk> .
and that 's also , so that <unk> against <unk> us will always <unk> .
yes , thank pants <unk> .
so , and i 've been great .
but i 'm not so let me in the company , <unk> that there have many bosses change that there is something happened .
and the reasons here in germany there 's always sort of mood .
and i <unk> and he would have a politician first to worry that the ants changes .
okay my boy who come over time .
how to go down the water .
what <unk> you know how can you change ?
this ?
<unk> ?
ten million ?
look at the down .
who see you ?
he declined .
so that if you do you can make you 're really change can .
or , mahatma <unk> to say , the change , you go in the world <unk> is going to itself .
you a beautiful words and big models , but how , because this work ?
are there was still <unk> few <unk> on our <unk> .
<unk> in all <unk> of crises , if you see you are <unk> something or if you <unk> <unk> and they have all there .
and if you 'll end of situations ask what <unk> you now despite <unk> <unk> i love your posture , of can physically , and powerful feeling .
<unk> i said , we 're talking about <unk> like a lot like this <unk> .
and finally , and <unk> ' `` you actually this crisis , what <unk> happening because you .
so i 'd like you already happening to the least <unk> .
yeah .
pants <unk> you .
and <unk> you 're really want to help on my <unk> way ?
yeah .
and realize that the two things .
first time <unk> on the clarity <unk> inside <unk> they 're going to your <unk> what will .
because of your perception .
and the second <unk> on your the attitude is going to .
because it <unk> you like the other people who have a behavior .
future of the only when our own perception .
<unk> you do this ?
yes , i think it .
thank pants <unk> well , this .
all good <unk> <unk> .
yeah .
we keep our <unk> ?
nice .
indeed , or a <unk> ?
and keep it 's because now , with that <unk> ?
this is a new <unk> ?
i mean , yeah .
there .
one of the u.s <unk> see .
<unk> means <unk> <unk> .
and that 's what the <unk> really is .
a <unk> from <unk> the <unk> .
and no , so , <unk> , <unk> .
this is <unk> .
and just <unk> for a very famous , <unk> .
so robert <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> or how they were hot .
let 's just in mind , <unk> .
and who maybe even from our <unk> the next leonardo of time .
you 're right here to <unk> .
maybe it would be <unk> told me with kids and their future <unk> because , yes , our future .
instead of the view of the most <unk> .
i spend a most part in prison .
four years ago , my father , and <unk> social entrepreneurship , <unk> i started .
we <unk> <unk> <unk> , which means they can be <unk> either <unk> do n't find out of <unk> lighter one , and then i think .
why <unk> very well , <unk> . <unk> , so those already failed at the big mistake in ?
our program is more not easy to understand how programs in the kids care .
and , i thought that the <unk> the last place in the things that work .
what do you is the most <unk> factor in childhood , people work with others ?
what we are positive models often , positive models .
and if you think about why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> that are often is it reminds us the father , <unk> work with that he <unk> the drugs <unk> or at ourselves in prison is .
and then a <unk> you think about what he from his life , and he may have better idea , as a different lives might look , no better models .
and he <unk> his father .
i <unk> to read martin .
martin 's <unk> our program .
dad was <unk> and around the family life the hell .
his 12 years of his mother died , and smaller and to go home .
there was he 's <unk> great .
he was shy and <unk> and so example of victims .
up to , as a smaller and a <unk> so roughly <unk> has been , on the are remained .
there <unk> one of time , the <unk> and he went on the <unk> and proposed system .
and this day he was <unk> .
and so it .
it was very well , to his life 's his father .
how it now , to i just described , and forth ?

you 're not much different than your illegal activities and their <unk> <unk> .
and then become one day with people , <unk> of that 's how their feelings of the same , which is no better models are .
so what you think about these people together , they 're together in prison , ?
we 're not much good .
and they make criminals are <unk> .
they sell , drugs on a higher level of the skies in the <unk> where they all <unk> <unk> .
and that leads me in germany , <unk> of <unk> percent .
that means in germany will be <unk> , criminals <unk> .
then there , people in prison is really going to .
but also these people wear a <unk> on the <unk> .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere , coming , as their first identity .
if you know , and if you an apartment , or not a private relationships to want to be familiar with that identity , with that <unk> faced with them <unk> in society , infinitely hard power .
this problem , we are .
we 're doing this problem to solve ?
and property , do you get many <unk> with ?
they will be surprised .
it <unk> abilities .
who 's a <unk> built it 's definitely no one of <unk> , from <unk> and <unk> .
only one issue <unk> has been a little <unk> something else about it 's not in prison <unk> .
properties to do something <unk> .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison authorities in three <unk> .
so , the <unk> of entrepreneurship and economy .
everybody in a own <unk> and everybody in a <unk> <unk> part .
and then <unk> we were also be <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> , and <unk> your personal relations and also the kinds <unk> .
what <unk> go out of our program out ?
it 's a great bandwidth is <unk> to <unk> for <unk> .
we have a <unk> , and <unk> .
a very bandwidth and <unk> `` i <unk> .
<unk> <unk> talent and his illusion that rapid , have been very early in trade with <unk> <unk> .
he had been fun for business , to run .
and then <unk> time , arrested .
and this <unk> has n't particularly , .
and the .
he says so today , he looked at his second <unk> prepared .
<unk> is he then the second time convicted .
he took the beginning of therapy , and then the <unk> .
and there learned about how to be <unk> talent for something <unk> use .
he 's in september <unk> , '' and then october <unk> his <unk> for <unk> started .
the <unk> 's <unk> you can now one of life .
he has been very good <unk> <unk> .
he is today with me here .
who would like <unk> want to him .
we go back to martin , and i the story .
martin , and his childhood education , chef <unk> and ended his found in the <unk> <unk> .
and alcohol , where there 's <unk> it was a cycle quite quickly started .
he parallel line , and as <unk> .
, has led to this life .
and he says , that he did with this lifestyle , not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
one day <unk> he would a <unk> hard that he was convicted .
he took the <unk> part of <unk> there 's really be changed my .
he learned very much more force gets more success and the quality to be able to <unk> to <unk> or without drugs to consume .
and he was the <unk> excited that he decided had this and he 'd <unk> .
and he wanted to become <unk> .
that has <unk> .
he works well , scarce two years old , and <unk> and collaborator on their way the freedom , because he ourselves that you 're actually change -- and when the right tools with your hand , in fact , than you often i want .
the base of successes are actually people like .
people with us , come to <unk> <unk> with us to our participants in their <unk> take your personal <unk> to <unk> .
are our <unk> the <unk> <unk> in our class people , that students , <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
and that are our <unk> our participants in the <unk> <unk> .
and these people a lot of our program with .
an example .
we do on our <unk> a practice . <unk> .
we <unk> then one of the great <unk> our participants in the world , and our <unk> the other side .
and i 'm going to questions .
and every when someone in this question : yeah answer , and the line .
and so what we have to hide within <unk> sit or outside .
but also the differences .
and one of the vast differences are just the following question .
i 'm in a so-called a focal up , or i had a <unk> what i once in <unk> was .
there are usually too many in the university , and just very few of <unk> .
now , i 'm talking about all connects us <unk> like to them .
i urge you 're all back up .
maybe we can a little light on the audience .
i can see it .
there are all .
great .
you .
i <unk> `` i say , this question : yeah questions . again , otherwise , just stand .
so this is our original pieces , we 're .
i have in my life illegal things done , i <unk> , it was n't .
so this question : yeah questions . please .
by counting money , <unk> car is .
by counting money , and a amounts <unk> obsessed .
by counting , it with the <unk> not exactly the right .
okay .
and it 's also , maybe each <unk> n't always work correctly <unk> .
all .
people would sit down .
we have a few angels of space .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
you , they all back down .
this question , if we have <unk> put into our <unk> very often , <unk> .
and you will also how much , they had this .
happiness with the parents ' happiness with the environment where you when faced with friends from happiness and that you may not always been caught a look at the edge of <unk> or , it .
what are the results of work ?
<unk> percent <unk> find ourselves within <unk> days after their <unk> of the .
that 's <unk> fast .
<unk> to have already <unk> done .
a third donors are past year , <unk> .
and our <unk> the top seven percent .
i had time in the <unk> of seven percent of a <unk> in germany , <unk> percent of .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> a year , <unk> <unk> euros .
and it 's a beautiful <unk> , <unk> which is a <unk> of seven percent of a <unk> , usually <unk> percent for a <unk> means .
my father and i 'm going to <unk> -- that we 're open <unk> a pretty much for quite nuts , .
i whistled at my great <unk> in a big companies that .
but i tell you 've got my life quite a <unk> work done .
we encourage our participants , and this .
and what in their lives in and responsibility for this is in your life going .
that are not to hide it to do with <unk> .
because that leads to a different way <unk> and to be located where they trust and
and makes me , i 'm proud of our participants , their way to .
<unk> , so i 'm a little video brought
film .
so i was convicted those two years after eight months , <unk> <unk> .
i was because <unk> against the <unk> to three years , ten months convicted .
i <unk> traded .
so i tried to judgment of two years , because <unk> <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation . <unk> has actually my <unk> life changed .
and what 's important was this <unk> , which is also done .
because there was `` yes , my absolute <unk> .
i was not <unk> , <unk> `` i say , yeah .
i got back to your eyes <unk> .
i got into perspective , i 've put forward <unk> .
and you do . awareness and <unk> from the <unk> out .
now it , <unk> a fixed , and then you , again , something <unk> .
with the wrong people together and does n't .
well , the problem is a lot of <unk> , if the <unk> .
the biggest problem because then automatically <unk> you 're back into the old <unk> coming .
you know , nothing else .
through this <unk> <unk> <unk> , on everything , which has taught me just my whole way to me to talk about other things that people with problems that people with the society that has to me , during this , a completely <unk> .
i 've been <unk> the first woman <unk> .
and <unk> six months <unk> and again with her .
that is so , we have a new relationship started .
and because i was the other crops by this whole <unk> and many other things changed . '' .
things , `` i 've done .
i 'm with my family back in <unk> of education started .
so i work today in my <unk> , <unk> `` i say .
i do is just <unk> , <unk> .
so that acknowledge that it , very many people who are actually , and my mentor , also about this time again , and to be yes , i do n't <unk> engagement to say , support .
i 'm grateful for them up with all come up , and so what do .
i 'm grateful for them , despite extreme kind of <unk> , and i 'm extremely grateful that part of the <unk> .
they belong of the whole of support services , .
i have said , people in the <unk> talked to me that confirms that 's good , we do it .
and <unk> i 've been removed .
and tell me tell you .
come with us prison .
every single day . .
or not our participants in their <unk> <unk> if they than the <unk> to us , or not in the recent financial support that are .
or not our program in a new <unk> the u.k. , very <unk> issue .
and so please .
martin <unk> and i am here today .
and <unk> on the conversation with them .
you .
<unk> 've been working <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal <unk> .
in fact , i <unk> was .
there , yeah .
we <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> go .
a <unk> in <unk> take .
there are today , many opportunities in the <unk> with .
<unk> how you <unk> with .
anyway , <unk> also <unk> .
with my work and so <unk> bit of <unk> .
one here i really <unk> talk .
and not of problems .
my problem was i was <unk> and could n't quite closely <unk> like my life in 10 , or 30 years look .
it was <unk> .
and this <unk> , frightening .
it ? <unk> express .
and i had a <unk> <unk> <unk> .

i did n't want , i <unk> way <unk> ?
do with me more comfortable ?
or what would n't mean <unk> again , <unk> ?
and look like then what happens .
and then , waiting .
that were so much .
i was time , <unk> a <unk> .
like <unk> .
the <unk> , and despite <unk> the absolute <unk> .
you <unk> the world lives in very good hotels and <unk> country in <unk> way .
<unk> but occasionally , <unk> countries .
in where it sure anymore , and say , as a <unk> villages , <unk> <unk> <unk> even though they would be a much and joy <unk> .
because of these images and <unk> . but a <unk> <unk> too .
and indeed , after the <unk> .
i was that what i did a little .
and <unk> .
and i found it <unk> of me about a country , and <unk> that i , you know .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to make <unk> .
and <unk> was writing .
and my personal interest to <unk> .
how to be a better know ?
by the population lives .
in the people live feed them home .
the hotel .
by himself with the challenges and with the problems were busy .
and by the people .
that was n't know , to ask them .
and that i wanted to do .
and i wanted to something <unk> .
i wanted a contribution it .
something good .
and this sense of the one of <unk> this <unk> .
i was , before , to go to nepal , and particularly touched .
until <unk> there 's a <unk> civil society by countless <unk> , but <unk> economic and social problems left .
with a <unk> <unk> of <unk> euros of nepal 's poorest country 1 , .
and counting continue to a week , poorest countries in the world .
a quarter of the underneath the .
the fifth of from the <unk> .
<unk> percent of adults can not read and write .
all these facts , and you very personal stories and <unk> paper on this journey <unk> hit me in fact , i was willing to open for change .
and i would do .
and <unk> stood up my <unk> of nepal my decision that .
i <unk> my job .
and <unk> me , and aid .
and i <unk> 're now let 's <unk> the answer <unk> going on my <unk> received .
because they just <unk> was .
it 's a <unk> <unk> , <unk> international <unk> .
and not a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> , wait in the first nepal . '' and a funding the <unk> brain .
hi ?
here yet ?
my <unk> was really seriously the very good .
we thought that .
and this was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really <unk> .
and i did of course , it 's emotional world .
and there never <unk> .
instead , like , but the intensive feeling that 's what good <unk> .
i used as a motor , when my own company to the reasons .
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
a company that basically exactly that what i was for myself .
which , a country anywhere in <unk> .
, a country right <unk> .
by the people to life and work .
and it 's somewhere in fact , but in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you can actually in two words <unk> .
so <unk> and <unk> .
so much like to place , which is <unk> collect .
because you really good .
sounds , <unk> little bit <unk> .
it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use in stone tool for sustainable development .
<unk> , we <unk> stone tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , <unk> the tourism .
because the people with us in a while your <unk> <unk> <unk> .
they pay for their journey of a <unk> .
but they travel very different .
they live in <unk> .
and that <unk> is n't you 're <unk> or you 're <unk> a real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and <unk> .
to engage in our participants in the <unk> and interests in different projects .
can go through our work the <unk> in urban areas , because otherwise no chance to the classic tourism .
because you to infrastructure that is .
the other tool in projects , .
we can write in projects <unk> and for .
so for us a few hundred percent .
are also not donations <unk> .
and that 's not just for our long <unk> engagement of meaning .
i started interacting with <unk> in nepal .
<unk> year we have our engagement in uganda <unk> .

we 're <unk> away from ?
or what would n't even bigger systems ?
if we <unk> this in ?
if we call a social engagement and sustainable in my talk about the wholeness , ?
and with the individual <unk> <unk> ?
or even <unk> individual <unk> .
that would then basically a little extra .
a company , that , and companies , .
other <unk> but the same philosophy , <unk> .
we might this ?
was the next question .
<unk> a company ?
sure we might arise .
we love , and their creative companies .
because we have <unk> .
because the same language .
because the same and dreams .
the challenges .
and so the last year <unk> a sister <unk> .
<unk> .
and with <unk> and we 're creative companies in development <unk> <unk> we 're in the support .
so <unk> the participants must be entrepreneurs of the staff of creative companies with individual <unk> <unk> .
so <unk> of the social and <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> stock market <unk> <unk> .
and there 's <unk> , again .
and using the next day <unk> <unk> yet another <unk> .
he shows up in relatively short , where you , or where you <unk> .
where you may still <unk> people .
where you might be so flexibly in the <unk> in thinking .
and he shows up on , you really good .
so on the strengths with eyes .
a pure creativity , a sudden , there is .
or a lot <unk> in new york city .
the <unk> things , you know if you can .
and the power of commitment devices to change .
and you very much change .
already in very short time .
we know that .
example .
that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
that there 's wonderful , from uganda .
and <unk> <unk> and talent .
they <unk> beautiful , <unk> <unk> years ago .
and since i was nothing .
because they have no market for .
because we know , quality of .
because i was said , which is perhaps the question .
so these women help .
and have a year , <unk> started .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
products of poverty .
and you a income .
the future will .
we are yesterday , <unk> live .
and we start with a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> a thousand <unk> of our women .

but us a dollar funded very much bigger .
this first <unk> is social <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a .
so who , you to , the with the purchase a <unk> make the other thing , but with us again directly into the travel .
he went back to travel in action <unk> .
long we might not only five women who work , but <unk> years ago .
and not only in uganda , but also in nepal and in other <unk> , we <unk> .
the but this <unk> just a project from all integrated cycle that .
we 're all to areas .
. <unk> <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work in just an area and this is .
what happens with the kids when the women working ?
exactly .
so the last year in nepal and in uganda , two <unk> <unk> started .
everything <unk> the cycle <unk> .
and all that makes more sense of each one project for them .
collaborator on , and <unk> in the different projects .
the <unk> opportunities to then they 're going to work .
and <unk> i want you 've seen directly on a journey to
and i urge you have to close .
<unk> `` you do you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on <unk> dining experiences .

you 've just with your <unk> at noon a .
there were <unk> .

until you do with your , <unk> .

i got it 's also a building <unk> of the <unk> the east , <unk> .
that 's building .
together with , other people , `` i <unk> last summer months for <unk> .
and so <unk> `` i tonight is driving them .
well , you may have some of you might say .
what 's why ?
<unk> there 's a lot .
but i want to briefly .
oh , or <unk> now <unk> ?
and her <unk> in park or how ?
just a little the basic questions , known as my colleagues asked them as they learn to be part of initiative , and i <unk> be able to do <unk> the <unk> .
all <unk> that we 're <unk> a series of <unk> <unk> .
and around these <unk> <unk> built up <unk> <unk> our banner put them .
and the privatization of <unk> to <unk> .
but who i know , you know that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was also not the <unk> <unk> health initiative .
what we 're seeing is a sign of <unk> passage in <unk> .
that 's a public space , and private space and so for many people are available under the <unk> `` i ca n't just not in public hand , and not be used to the public spaces may use .
we were a group of <unk> <unk> in the desire to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> very sensitive and sustainable to deal
and we wanted to <unk> .
we were a <unk> team and that i have to now , and then the because it was a very <unk> team .
lot of the <unk> socially , in politics -- and <unk> <unk> the probability of design process of photography <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
this is also different social networking , and personal <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and we were these are different skills , on various networks <unk> .
and creative , <unk> solutions in the <unk> we have done in the <unk> to <unk> .
we 've actually <unk> the <unk> to <unk> .
however , like us about that we <unk> with stories and ideas <unk> .
we have your memories and to ask .
and these memories and images were trying to <unk> for the <unk> to create .
and it was very important that the process , <unk> up .
as a way we 've always as <unk> platform and as <unk> terms .
so <unk> a <unk> and <unk> <unk> and i went to a <unk> .
in the experiences we 've done , <unk> `` i tonight , .
every city has <unk> places .
more walkable neighborhood a face .
in cases where , however <unk> and <unk> the presence of an experienced by the <unk> .
they are the dead places , because i often do n't <unk> we 're in the expect .
so , for that we <unk> who have <unk> .
, but also the fact that 's an urban places <unk> , this will often <unk> .
initiatives create these places <unk> want to stay in addition <unk> interest in the <unk> stuck .
what do with me to do it 's some questions , like some of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places in the city not just a face .
no .
they are the networking , the city , in our <unk> 's happening .
so <unk> we 're often , <unk> <unk> to our neighbors , if we happen on the way to meet .

and we just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> sometimes .
but what you , is a sense of community .
more <unk> . in the public space . '' is the more than in just like this community .
and if i get <unk> , and i 'll tell you think of anonymity . <unk> .
we were then two challenges .
we can at an awareness of responsibility and engagement for your neighborhood <unk> , <unk> also <unk> .
, `` protest of creation transformed by ?
how can critique those ideas transformed by ?
protest against the privatization of <unk> this <unk> <unk> places and criticism , <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that same places .
imagine now , here are going to us the newspaper , and read the text .
and <unk> and citizens , we invite you can we want to three possible <unk> for the <unk> the <unk> imagine an example , carefully <unk> <unk> designed .
they 're <unk> at the idea of variation <unk> .
and the variation with the most <unk> and then <unk> of .
they would go ?
would anyone of them to this an ?
probably not .
why ?
i mean , it sounds like a great .
there 's <unk> opportunity to <unk> .
they <unk> like the future .
and said , sounds like it 's first moment .
i 'm trying to me anyway , popular explanation .
and it 's opinion , they ca n't really <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , <unk> .
first understand classical <unk> often too late <unk> .
that means mostly they have n't have no opportunity to write <unk> to make a fundamental alternatives for discussing what 's actually already <unk> design and allowed <unk> a group , they <unk> or <unk> in the urban <unk> plants .
or a friend recently , and what color , <unk> for example .
second that classical <unk> 's rarely the information and <unk> beyond .
if you the three <unk> <unk> .
we have been able to show you 're allowed to <unk> .
frustration and <unk> are often talk about what i also kind <unk> think .
but anyway , no choice about <unk> or <unk> hit when i should rather <unk> <unk> , instead <unk> <unk> had done .
it 's a different .
although we <unk> the <unk> <unk> many , <unk> , we have ultimately , <unk> experience .
it 's experiences <unk> and the first , for <unk> .
i want to <unk> we have initiatives in other projects , or not the <unk> and present policy .
because of those kinds of these <unk> actually do n't seem to really responsible for the processes are .
when i really interested in <unk> of how many <unk> and <unk> and then we need and then we need <unk> new <unk> .
and finally <unk> me , but also they 're here today are .
and so , because i <unk> for all think .
i mean , it 's important to give you go ahead and i gave rise to encourage the <unk> still a chance to give them .
and i <unk> at all of people who are working <unk> a new <unk> <unk> .

one willingness for the dialogue , <unk> .
in <unk> the professionals , <unk> senior citizens on <unk> and many interests <unk> .
what we 're seeing is a <unk> , and we invited .
what we 're seeing some <unk> and <unk> the conversation with an .
the needs to be of these conversation on <unk> will , so they 're not the <unk> interests , <unk> <unk> , <unk> the citizens .
and their local traditional experts , they are experts for your neighborhood , you know them in the <unk> it up with a place to work , which in a place , and also to local , .
the <unk> of the city can <unk> , which is <unk> the next project <unk> do .

this leads to a <unk> in the same information for all available , and then the place <unk> can be .
and you traces we can be a <unk> the <unk> these .
a dialogue , <unk> means that i wish to <unk> actually serious out .
and it also , somebody says , i want to <unk> the <unk> .
that can course , <unk> be able to adapt to be in <unk> dialogue with all of <unk> , what 's the right solution and maybe in <unk> then also <unk> <unk> , but maybe one another place .
i 've come from the dialogue , then the .
second point of <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> is <unk> .
it feels , probably is a <unk> great group , and talk .
another thing , well , but if you ca n't <unk> great group .
another . maybe , or in .
or make his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i it , <unk> give up with <unk> <unk> .
we have for example , just to come to be looking at the time <unk> what happens .
in <unk> small exhibition .
we have , he <unk> to give them .
we have the very glamorous painting .
we have the opportunity had to write .
independent from age .
that was a <unk> girl .
we had to our ideas with <unk> to connect to play with the <unk> .
well , outside of <unk> <unk> to participate , should always been .
that can for example of <unk> happen , that can <unk> <unk> happen .
the <unk> and <unk> <unk> the results and the dialogue , <unk> .
we even have the entire process parallel , accompanied me on a lot <unk> blog , news <unk> over <unk> distributed .
our third <unk> .
you remember , perhaps , i said , <unk> the late will .
, <unk> an there 's already are finished <unk> .
<unk> is the process but then when he <unk> happening and the <unk> in <unk> even still ca n't know , <unk> area that it .
if through the dialogue , and so i 'm going to point in the way , <unk> will be a very large area in the question .
<unk> the way for instance <unk> itself .
and then we 're beginning to put <unk> is that the <unk> an easy to look at a new experiences from the <unk> <unk> .
what happens if you look at their own city <unk> and your city <unk> .
so in <unk> projects .
i got to an example from <unk> this is the <unk> it 's probably of the known .
i was just a project launched , because here . <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> there are within six weeks <unk> dollars to come from the funding to make should we <unk> .
it has led in august of politics could n't really differently than the idea of their own .
but <unk> in new york , and i <unk> `` i do n't say , because now , the most <unk> the city of no idea , or <unk> .
the world <unk> for the <unk> were doing that .
in <unk> they 're going back in germany have the citizens , <unk> plans to <unk> one <unk> , again <unk> .
the city and then , the <unk> 's not needed .
four weeks <unk> amount of <unk> <unk> a rich , as <unk> .
today is the <unk> the city <unk> .

<unk> paint their own <unk> on the street .
in rotterdam came to <unk> <unk> .
ok , i want you can say .
then , but now , so on .
but i think it 's a lot of responsibility .
why ?
anyway , because they have a look for the whole , or have .
while <unk> to be better citizens initiatives like to the rule , for you know , <unk> to focus on the city against the responsibility for these kinds of the edge of attention .
and of course , the city , `` does n't stand on a available .
a <unk> initiative that only <unk> the .

<unk> stood up <unk> has the <unk> in january bought .
it happen . <unk> .
so we now unfortunately , the problem , and yet <unk> .
but we know , that they 're going to the city , <unk> successful <unk> , <unk> actually successful that 's a <unk> will .
in the form of happening , however , open .
and finally , to come i 'm convinced that many projects protect their importance of complexity or the cost of all evolved to be a chance of happiness consent to <unk> a .
if you only time and in dialogue with an <unk> .
in each of the city an .
in each of the city that you tonight , sit down .
if we <unk> claim same amount of the <unk> the citizens , more than <unk> , but <unk> .
.
night , <unk> we were here in <unk> in <unk> and so , <unk> come .
we have <unk> about .
so , this idea one more <unk> second chance to have to do n't <unk> has been very long time <unk> second chance .
we found very exciting .
and we were actually relatively fast . <unk> it 's two things that there , we still respond to be .
and it 's hit puberty .
second , there was also the university at the time in school ?
, .
, .
you some of them . , <unk> out <unk> .
, `` yes , are now , <unk> years , but the words to me immediately grasp <unk> hands .
my neck <unk> come together and i just want back to <unk> .
and then i do n't afford them , but in my exams and then always active denial continues to <unk> seriously , has been sitting at me .
no idea what we actually become .
they 're trying to see them , my school was really beautiful and after i then my <unk> , i was completely clear , again , school .
and what i say that trusting each <unk> <unk> some of days , she said , and he did i believe in schools .
with the desire and , voluntary .
i came out what ?
how could n't happen ?
i started to respond to look at that something is what i 'm going calculating .
i got kids .
so , my wife and the children .
and so , and then also very clear that they <unk> the world . <unk> of .
up to the day , when she said , honey is to <unk> .
and said , you go .
yes , <unk> .
there were opened up the door and she sat down there , in this <unk> and <unk> i felt i <unk> in the <unk> .
i saw the things like it was taught us <unk> .
and that <unk> also like to school at <unk> i think that <unk> to me , `` here , yes , <unk> changed .
and then the teacher to say , and you know , `` the kids learn have my school , but it 's live there <unk> `` i told , one sentence , i mean , then , <unk> .
what is that we 're from the day from that school , for my life really <unk> have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really good learned .
where you may actually in <unk> , really good need ?
and you some of the capital of <unk> means .
what 's still respond <unk> ?
or <unk> , this ability to <unk> time you 're going on in the <unk> , just keep throwing it 's <unk> again <unk> can get a bad ?
well , i got a long time it for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what 's a <unk> of one <unk> one way , if you a good doctor ?
if you <unk> , and whether the good <unk> properties ?
, .
so , for my life , have my school , we .
if we 're <unk> , is about <unk> the middle <unk> century , there may say that i voted themselves .
so that time to live in germany , <unk> then eventually , introduced .
and where the school , and it has its roots .
and the time , imagine then it was actually , so , and then we had no access to know their time .
and there were these four or six years , of forced by saying , and they 're crammed they were n't really the only way of the wright , when you know , and facts and the information , in touch .
today has a <unk> more information in his pocket of the library of <unk> time .
and the <unk> century that was the time <unk> .
that means there has some changes in the world and there were suddenly people needs of these new machines <unk> .
simultaneously , but also people needs of these machines , and repair .
and we needed to these machines build , and these factories <unk> .
maybe you time .
that <unk> system , that today . in germany , you imagine , which has the time .
and there is possibly make .
also because it was probably really , what you have learned was a lot of the <unk> , `` who are <unk> stood there stood there is a whole .
we do <unk> look at the future .
let 's <unk> century , where it 's , and so , <unk> .
this year <unk> was that , there was the first <unk> i 'm going <unk> .
i was with my <unk> finished and now is the time , and you <unk> the first company .
yes , after some of around in the internet , then <unk> i 'm going to <unk> `` i 've also bacterial sand .
and some company of us <unk> they were bigger and bigger , and we are beautiful slow grown up , and some of the entire companies are of us again , and in <unk> .
you see , two times in life .
and then , but 30 staff .
so , we had such a beautiful , and we had so exciting professions , how <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't whether they <unk> <unk> to have to these people , but , and we had no idea is that has ever give yourself .
and i <unk> did was so what the internet has n't talk .
and the kids that , send people in the previous ten chances <unk> as well , or 30 years ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and you know , which is the need to take the future jobs in order to be ?
and if you 're looking at the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we <unk> so the future of the who could get fusion <unk> a saturday .
there 's <unk> <unk> as well , `` i read .
well , you see , they have no idea .
you get to figure out to school for my life , it ?
what are the things we need to take kids for my life <unk> to do ?
and maybe it 's a look at all of our companies today 's staff . .
that are now , the <unk> of school , yeah ?
the <unk> from schools universities and then the company .
and if you <unk> classic <unk> look , then , there is the first , yes , so what , like the expertise .
i want it , so , and then , we <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and twelve years , <unk> .
that will be now , in n't afford .
what school , but it all these things are still important things , are the size of <unk> <unk> <unk> and i 'm so convinced that this <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the future are .
and you can basically the groups <unk> .
that 's the same company of the staff , both flexibly and so <unk> 's .
i wish that are almost all their employees with <unk> thinking .
and then we wish , their employees , the <unk> are .
so we have <unk> <unk> thinking and <unk> .
let 's <unk> .
that 's relatively fast <unk> .
if we look at the economy that works , how fast , yes , how fast , it changes .
<unk> yes , <unk> be the internet today , and that .
we need to my staff devices with this change could safely .
we need to give employees , the creative .
we need to give employees , the <unk> are .
and that the opposite of what to look at the end <unk> the kitchen staff , <unk> it .
the second issue that <unk> think is relatively .
there is the world .
there is the lack of responsibility .
first time , and her own life .
but for a whole .
it does that company is , as want to the responsibility for a whole .
and the third factor of the <unk> , which is almost all the <unk> .
and if we 've been <unk> <unk> environment , and there on these beautiful <unk> .
argentina . <unk> <unk> portugal , <unk> and germany has a team .
it was not <unk> <unk> of <unk> won .
that could n't work together .
and that someone , and innovator great friend steve jobs , <unk> .
it was not the is an iphone invented by the way to do n't <unk> invented by the way to <unk> n't invented a lot of invented .
i had a team , that possible it 's just together to do this is done .
so <unk> school , these three things , could n't know about it <unk> school , for my life .
but there <unk> fourth is , and the is almost more .
and that 's a respect themselves .
if that the only about the future you say , they 're not yet , but the ability to go up to learn more fun , to have to learn to the <unk> , in <unk> life , and that our children in <unk> a successful .
what about , but <unk> school , so all of .
but where i was ?
i sat in this <unk> and the most of our children , which is not just <unk> an open-source , you <unk> to .
so <unk> an the motto of all , but there are grateful .
up to the point where <unk> elected , and then suddenly , invisible .
yes , i sat there 's what i say , and <unk> my kids were these <unk> the <unk> parts of an .
less <unk> was it 's my father , if you 're going to stress around the subject , and learn from the whole family <unk> .
and less fun makes a little kid was going to school stress and .
and finally ended up <unk> or was a peak of <unk> this school , again , <unk> <unk> .
i took it was also not <unk> , it was 're a <unk> , so i came from hour and in fact , the single parents were invited .
and i <unk> `` i also the details <unk> the time in have to our child there <unk> , that 's how do n't know .
<unk> , but two years , we <unk> have , there 's something else .
what do we actually right ?
and we 're actually , the question this is our child broken ?
and we are the only way , which is that 's how ?
now , `` i the last two years since i was in the subject <unk> with people talked about it is that , i got me , you 're not alone .
there are many of a similar , and that was two years ago , there was a <unk> <unk> together we are not a company to the reasons for <unk> us about the journey , there <unk> , and sat down the bar and have a private things <unk> .
and what should i say , he said , the same story , with his children 's the same experienced , and we had enough to make our children there <unk> could from school , yeah ?
in berlin , so that <unk> <unk> a different schools and even <unk> into it .
but can that everybody out there ?
i was that we do this little bit of our children in safety to go and <unk> out there 's going to see , are .
and after we both the impression , it has since we were n't really changed because we , right , we are the first , there 's going to make .
and how we as <unk> there is something that ?
good news . <unk> .
we are not alone .
but we did relatively fast <unk> whole range of great people found that we 're similar to manage to <unk> in the way <unk> <unk> .
it 's not so they 're just the children and their parents , i call out there often happens .
if the teachers at 30 percent of teachers have <unk> .
if what we look out of <unk> the last 10 years , this has doubled .
so you have to be that all parents were wrong ?
that all these broken , and also a break down ?
or so you do n't have a system that we just not only fits like this <unk> years <unk> in the size fits quite often was right .
and we have many people found out of us went and we have even people found the children .
and they understood that they responsibility , for the future of responsibility , for the future , responsibility for what we 're feeding our kids are now , to go with the way .
and we 've been working <unk> second , <unk> are out there <unk> whole range of great initiatives like to change , and there are <unk> schools , here 's really great <unk> and it 's almost like every school teacher at a really <unk> they do want .
and even the marketplace or <unk> principal , and then also <unk> the first step .
and how we should now , <unk> help ?
we have no concept that we 're going to help .
but we can thing you can go in schools , and we can these schools in high school , and so the parents the teachers and the student , <unk> and we can work in two days <unk> lot .
there are so people together , the past . 're <unk> who have to learn in two days , what it means that .
they come with <unk> the concrete challenge of them together .
and after two games days and then , for a new <unk> , or <unk> given for <unk> completely new high as a <unk> school , <unk> allowed .
or have <unk> , for <unk> problems are in their school education .
within two days , and <unk> the next day , of the .
but what that <unk> what these two days , and that makes me , this beautiful representation of <unk> , i 've just a long time in schools , germany , to spend it 's this energy , and if the three things .
if the three things together , and so what we <unk> <unk> .
so <unk> thinking and if you together experience .
it 's a <unk> , the <unk> .
and if we four weeks after the <unk> <unk> , <unk> go back then they 're going to take a whole , you have to change that there <unk> completely new culture that is .
and that 's <unk> .
and i <unk> and they 'll invite your own school to think .
i <unk> and they 'll invite the school .
and i <unk> me , and i invite you very excited about you to talk .
talk about what you do n't talk to do n't tell you do .
they will be surprised to be how much <unk> they get people i experienced , but just not about .
so , let 's every single day in germany , <unk> century .
so it education .
and so that they do with the school every single day are the parents , the teachers and the students .
because they can we do .
thank you .
