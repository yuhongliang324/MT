you know , one of the <unk> to travel and one of <unk> the <unk> research is to share with the people to live , even at the old days remember , the past that still in the wind to feel , you on the rain <unk> rocks touch , you in the <unk> leaves the plants taste .
just the knowledge that <unk> still the milky way of or the importance of myths the oldest the <unk> a full of meaning , or that the himalayas the buddhist still the breath of <unk> tracking , which means to the central epiphany of anthropology on the memory to call this is the idea that the world , we live , not in a total sense , but only as a model of reality , as a a group of certain ways to adapt to our know , <unk> successful , many generations chose .
and of how we all the same <unk> .
we 're all born . we teach kids to the world .
we went through <unk> .
and we have looked at the <unk> separation from the death <unk> and thus should it 's no surprise that we all , dancing and and art can .
but what 's the unique <unk> of <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it plays it does n't matter , whether it the <unk> in the forests of a is , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior , in the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> in the sahara . this is just a colleague , with me a month in the desert around me , or even a <unk> to hang the <unk> . everest , the <unk> the world .
all these people to teach us that there yet another <unk> , other <unk> , other ways to an orientation on earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about , one with just hope fulfill .
together , the <unk> cultures , the world a network of <unk> and <unk> life that the earth <unk> and for this is probably the earth as important is what that biological <unk> that you a biosphere .
and you are the cultural <unk> as a <unk> . <unk> , and when the sum of thoughts and dreams , myths ideas , <unk> and <unk> , by the human ability for the beginnings of consciousness generated , be defined .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it 's the symbol of all of what we are , and what we as an amazing <unk> species are able .
and as the biosphere , away , did this with the <unk> -- just with a greater the speed .
not a biologist 'd like , dare to suggest that 50 percent or more of all kinds shortly before the extinction , because it just not true , and yet , this -- that <unk> <unk> on the area of biological diversity , which is n't wait , which gives us as <unk> <unk> on the area of cultural diversity 's known .
and the indicator of that 's the species of languages .
as any of them in this room was born , were on earth 6,000 languages .
now is a language not just the totality of <unk> or a number of <unk> .
a language is an expression of human mind .
it 's a means , with the the soul a particular culture access to the material world is .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a point , a thought , an ecosystem <unk> possibilities .
and of these 6,000 languages are today , as we 're here in monterey sit , exactly half of no longer in the ears of kids <unk> .
they 're <unk> not be taught . so , if nothing done is , they 're actually been dead .
what could lonely , as the silence <unk> to be one of some people to be that your language , no way , the wisdom of the ancestors <unk> , or the hope kids to expect ?
and yet <unk> this horrible fate and somebody somewhere on earth , you ca : all over two weeks , because of two weeks , dies an older people and takes the last <unk> an old language to the grave .
and i know that some of you say , it 's not better ? '' is the world 's not a better place , if we all just a language to be ? '' and i say , `` well , let the language <unk> , let them <unk> .
let them kogi . ''
and then they would you suddenly , how it would you get their own language ca n't talk .
so i want you today in on a journey through the <unk> take a quick voyage through the <unk> to try to them understand , what actually lost gone .
now there are some of us , the kind forget that i , when i say `` different ways of being , `` really different ways way of mine .
let 's like , this child the <unk> the northwest of the amazon , the people who <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> the middle of the belly of sacred snakes <unk> .
this is a people , what do n't cognitively between the color of blue and green different , because the <unk> the forest that the people depend on , <unk> .
they have a <unk> language and a <unk> the <unk> <unk> called is : you have to marry , the one language is .
so <unk> in the <unk> past . that <unk> the big houses , in which because of <unk> six or seven languages spoken to is that you 've never going to hear that a language is learning .
you 're just to and start then to talk .
or , one of <unk> tribes , with whom i ever lived , the <unk> the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first came in 1958 peaceful <unk> .
in 1957 to five <unk> contact to record and made a <unk> mistakes .
they threw <unk> photos of yourself from the air down , what we as a friendly gesture them . and <unk> you that these people from the rainforest in your life , never be something <unk> seen .
they raised these photographs from the forest , trying behind the face or the character , did n't and <unk> that this <unk> of the devil are and kill the five <unk> with a javelin .
but the <unk> kill not just <unk> with a javelin .
they <unk> to each other .
54 percent of deaths happened through <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations back and found two million cases of a natural death and when we the people with <unk> something about <unk> , gave them to that one of people like , and become was that he 's based on his age of and we kill him , with a javelin .
but at they had a clear <unk> of forests , the amazing .
their <unk> were able to the urine of an animal from 40 steps of smell and determine , which species that matched .
in the early <unk> years ago i got a really amazing job , when i was my professor at harvard , if i 'm interested in would , in haiti to go and the secret societies , <unk> the foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the venom , it to use it was to <unk> to make sure .
and this <unk> a sense to give i had of something about this remarkable think of <unk> knowledge and <unk> is not <unk> of the magic .
the contrary , it 's a complex <unk> <unk> .
it 's interesting .
if i want to ask , the major world <unk> , what would you say ?
christianity , that islam , in buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent is left out , because the <unk> was that it in sub-saharan africa is no religious faith 'll end of course there was an and <unk> 's just the <unk> this very <unk> religious thought that during the tragic diaspora , <unk> <unk> .
but what <unk> so interesting , is the living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living <unk> the spirit .
the spirit , from the big water <unk> going to respond to the rhythm of the dance to the soul of living <unk> the crowd , so that the <unk> for a short <unk> moment for god .
<unk> , the <unk> like , `` the white goes into the church , and you about god .
we see the temples , and we 're going to god . ''
and because you with , are you about the spirit <unk> , how do you damage <unk> ?
you see these amazing demonstrations , <unk> in a <unk> that <unk> coal , <unk> <unk> , an amazing <unk> the ability of mind the body to influence that it <unk> , when he in a state of the extreme arousal <unk> .
now , of all people that i 've met , were the kogi from the sierra nevada de santa <unk> in <unk> , the extraordinary .
offspring the old <unk> civilization , the <unk> plain from colombia <unk> and in a consequence of conquest moved out that people in a <unk> <unk> massively back , and over the <unk> plain <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , they were these people the only that never heard of the <unk> conquered .
until the present day , you from a <unk> priesthood governed by the training to priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> be at age of three and four years of their families apart and in a <unk> world of <unk> , in <unk> the <unk> the glacier for 18 years <unk> , two periods of at nine years ago , whether chosen to nine months of pregnancy <unk> that you in my lap their <unk> mother spent the time you <unk> in my lap of the mother .
and during this whole time , you culturally in the values of society in the values that the claim <unk> that your prayers and just your prayers of the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance <unk> .
so at this amazing <unk> they get one day of the outside , and the first time in your life , at age of 18 years ago , is a <unk> , and in this <unk> moment of consciousness of the light , if the sun 's starting to the <unk> the incredibly beautiful landscape of the rays , suddenly everything that you in abstract 've learned in an amazing <unk> confirmed , and the priest <unk> back and says , `` you see ? it 's really , as i 'm telling .
so it 's wonderful . you have it . ''
they call the older brothers and say that we do that we 've got the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world together .
now this level of intuition is very important .
and if we 're going to <unk> and landscape , <unk> we 're <unk> and the old <unk> of <unk> wild up , in its <unk> a <unk> thought , or on <unk> and say , these people are more about the nature connected , when we .
so , <unk> are n't sentimental , they get off the nostalgia <unk> .
it is not a place for the <unk> swamps , <unk> or the cold <unk> from tibet , they have but nevertheless , through time and ritual a <unk> <unk> earth is shaped , not on the idea that 's , you know close to be , but on a far <unk> intuition , the idea that the earth , only exists , because it in the human consciousness <unk> .
now , which means that ?
it means that a little kid from the andes , where they grow up that the mountain a <unk> is that his or your destiny determine that 's a whole other person , and a different relationship to this resource , this place , as a little kid in montana , where they grow up to be a mountain a bunch of stones , the away .
if he was a <unk> one , or a bunch <unk> about it is irrelevant .
what 's the metaphor that relationship between the individual and the nature is .
i grew up in the forests of british colombia , and believed that these forests and there are , <unk> .
it made me to a different people as my friends of <unk> who believe that these forests of <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> spirit , the <unk> the housing , our minds that you of <unk> participate .
now , if you start to the idea at that these cultures are realities create , you can see some of their extraordinary discoveries . , this plant here .
it 's a picture that i just last april the northwest of the amazon <unk> .
this is <unk> of a lot of you heard , the most <unk> <unk> from the repertoire of <unk> .
what <unk> so fascinating is that 's not only that <unk> potential of this <unk> , but of processing . it 's really for two different sources made up on the one hand , there are these wooden <unk> that a number of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , slightly <unk> , <unk> . this <unk> alone <unk> 's sort of such as if a blue <unk> smoke at their minds put it will , with the leaves of <unk> from the family of <unk> with the name <unk> <unk> mix .
this plant contains a very strong <unk> the of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar .
if you 've been looking at the <unk> have seen , this stuff <unk> , the substance , which they made of different ways to contains also <unk> .
this <unk> to <unk> 's like a <unk> <unk> to be , <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the landing on a sea level of electricity .
it 's no distortion of reality is , but the resolution of reality .
i 've even with my professor , richard <unk> <unk> , the man , which the <unk> <unk> with the discovery of the magic fungi in mexico in the <unk> years <unk> , about being discussed . i said that you have these <unk> not as <unk> categorize , because the moment where you the impact feels , you do that there is to a <unk> to experience .
but the deal with <unk> is that they do n't <unk> <unk> can be , because it through a in the human gut , of <unk> enzyme that name <unk> , <unk> .
you can only in connection with a different chemicals <unk> <unk> going to the mao <unk> .
now this fascinating is that the <unk> that in the <unk> contain , <unk> of the kind of the necessary , the <unk> to <unk> . ask you are .
how do these people from a <unk> by 80,000 kinds <unk> of these two morphologically not related plants and find that , once in this way combined , a kind of <unk> version of creating , so that the bigger than the of its parts ?
we use these great <unk> , trial and error , which is as being out .
but ask you the indians do they say , `` the plant talks to us . ''
so , which means that ?
this tribe , the <unk> , 17 varieties of <unk> that they all the great distance in the forest is recognizing that for our eyes as a kind appear .
and then ask you , their <unk> <unk> and they say , i thought you understand something of plants .
i mean , you had nothing ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns out that you each of 17 varieties of <unk> <unk> and they sing , in a different <unk> .

now , that <unk> the problem is that even those of us that sympathy for the difficult to the indigenous , you as <unk> and <unk> look , but somehow on the past <unk> , during the real world , that is our world , <unk> .
so in fact is that you look at the 20th century , and over 300 years not for his war or technological innovation remember , but rather than at an era , we <unk> , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity of the earth 're actively supported or a passive <unk> . so the problem is not the change .
all cultures , again and the dance with new <unk> involved .
and the problem is not the technology , .
the <unk> were not less on the sioux , when they bow , and the arrow tasks , when the americans <unk> americans , when they horse and <unk> tasks .
ca n't change and technology threaten the integrity of <unk> . it 's power . that ugly face the rule .
and where , you look at the world <unk> , you will discover that these cultures , not the <unk> <unk> , this is dynamic living people , whose existence by <unk> forces <unk> is about their capacity to adapt beyond -- whether it all about the <unk> <unk> the country of <unk> is , a <unk> from asia , from <unk> , a people that a generation of the forest lived , and now to <unk> and prostitution the river <unk> , from where you can see that even the flow with the mud <unk> , of nearly half a in the <unk> sea <unk> . from where the japanese <unk> the horizon to see is that are ready , their <unk> with your brute force <unk> to fill that you the forest <unk> , or as in case of <unk> , where it <unk> is that during the <unk> <unk> .
or if we 're in the mountains of tibet , where i <unk> much <unk> , you that ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide that <unk> extinction of people 's generally convicted , but the <unk> , the destruction of the way of people who will not just not convicted , but generally , and <unk> as part of a <unk> celebrated .
and you can see the suffering <unk> n't understand , if you ca n't it on <unk> level have .
i went to deal with a young colleagues 6,000 miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> through <unk> after <unk> and only when i <unk> , i saw the face the statistics of which you hear about 6,000 holy <unk> , the rubble , ashes into . 1.2 million people that during the cultural revolution of the <unk> killed .
the father of this young <unk> was as his followers of <unk> lama identified .
this meant that he was during the chinese invasion immediately killed .
his uncle <unk> with their sanctity of the diaspora , the people in nepal , .
his mother was locked up , when punishment for -- for the crime <unk> .
he was at age of two years in the prison <unk> to be under your <unk> to hide , because they without it does n't live .
the nurse , these <unk> did <unk> , in a <unk> .
one day joined them from <unk> on a <unk> <unk> and for these <unk> had to them for seven years in a for <unk> .
this is <unk> can <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people 's something <unk> .
and by the we are really a choice . we would like in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity of life ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist said before she died , it their greatest fear is , while we 're moving towards the one thread , <unk> , <unk> <unk> move , we do n't just the whole range of human ability to <unk> way reduced to see , but that we have one day from a dream up , and remember , that there any other possibilities .
and it 's <unk> to think that our species , maybe for over 600,000 years exist .
the <unk> revolution that allow us that 's got , and look at this moment where <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the poetry of <unk> through the <unk> the priesthood <unk> and hierarchy , <unk> and surplus created -- was going to 10,000 years .
the modern industrial world as we know it 's hardly 300 years old .
now , these <unk> history tells me not that we all the answers to the challenges , we 've been in the next millennia to stand .
if we have these <unk> <unk> after the importance of being , answering them with 10,000 various voices .
and in this song that we 're going to <unk> that , what we are , people with <unk> consciousness , the importance of this is that all people and gardens a room flourish , can <unk> to deal . and there 's great moments of the optimism .
here is a picture that i the northern the <unk> <unk> , when i with <unk> on the <unk> went , and this guy , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his <unk> .
and the government is not always very good at the <unk> <unk> and during the <unk> years in with the <unk> our regime , they were forced to settlements to .
the grandfather of this old man 's refused to .
the family , the fear for his life , took him out of guns and all these tools .
now have you know that <unk> no fear of the cold , because they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> their <unk> , originally from a fish , in <unk> <unk> , made .
the grandfather of man was n't have to the arctic night , or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> to go out , your pants down from <unk> down and <unk> in his hand , and when the <unk> to <unk> started to what he put them in the shape of <unk> .
he <unk> <unk> on the sides of <unk> and when it all the frozen , <unk> he 's a dog that .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a <unk> , took this skeleton of the dog and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> a different dog , and <unk> about the <unk> with the <unk> the belt .
you can get out to make something .
and this is in many ways a symbol for the resistance of <unk> and all indigenous the world .
and the government was the <unk> in april 1999 the complete control of an area , that it 's in california , texas .
it 's our new country and does <unk> .
it 's a <unk> area . they control all <unk> .
an amazing example , as a nation , a state , the <unk> with his people are looking and achieve .
and finally , i think it 's pretty obvious , for those of us that to have goals of earth around , to realize that they do n't get away .
they are the <unk> from someone .
they represent the human imagination , the past when <unk> , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our own children of the <unk> of hope .
what we 're looking at national geographic , trying to do is that we think that will never going to achieve .
we think that <unk> -- we think that <unk> n't persuasive , but we think that storytelling change the world , and so we 're probably the institution for storytelling in the world . our website get 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations send our <unk> .
so the magazines , many of millions read .
and we do a number of travel in the <unk> , which we our audience to places of such cultural wondering take them to of you <unk> , and hopefully , you one after the other the central epiphany of anthropology on , that the world it deserves , on different ways to exist that we have a <unk> in a very multicultural <unk> to find , in the wisdom of all people to our common to contribute .
thank you .
what i first , as fast as possible to show me , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we microsoft as part of a <unk> ago exactly a year , to have this is <unk> , and it 's an environment , they 're locally . right away with huge amounts of visual data around .
we see many , <unk> of digital photographs here that transition and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , at any way to <unk> .
and it 's no matter , how many of information we look , how large that collections , or how big the pictures .
most of you 're digital <unk> a camera , but this is , for a scan of the <unk> and it 's in a range of 300 <unk> .
it does n't matter , because the only thing that the performance of a system as this <unk> is the number of <unk> on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of <unk> , every <unk> is a chapter .
to show that it 's really about a text and not about a picture is , we can see something like this , to really show that an actual representation of <unk> and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial kind of a <unk> to read .
i would n't recommend .
this is a <unk> case , this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of <unk> .
and that gives you really the pleasure and the good experience a real <unk> a magazine , or a newspaper to read , which , a kind of medium with multiple magnitude .
we also something about the corner of these special edition of the guardian .
we have a false <unk> with very high <unk> designed that much higher than at a regular <unk> is and we have an extra content added .
if you see the features of cars look like , you can see here .
or different models , or even reverse engineering <unk> .
and this grabs really these ideas on , those limits of the available place on the screen <unk> .
we hope that 's not pop-ups and other nonsense , which means -- that should n't need to be .
, of the <unk> one of really obvious applications for a technology as this .
and i 'd like this really not much time , except to say that we also to this area contribute .
but these are all roads in the <unk> .
<unk> up on the <unk> picture of the nasa .
let 's going to out .
now this is actually live in the internet , you can <unk> .
this is a project with the name <unk> that really two different technologies together .
one is <unk> and the other is a very good research on <unk> , from noah <unk> , a <unk> at the washington , the advice from steve <unk> at the <unk>
and rick <unk> of microsoft research did was a very good working together .
so this is live in the internet . it 's <unk> driven .
you can do it 's see if we do this kind of views create , where we by images penetrate , and that experience of <unk> <unk> .
but the of for the imagery is here in fact , of meaning .
the <unk> have these pictures together <unk> and the real space , where these images that all the near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> were made , are . you see here elements of <unk> slides , or <unk> <unk> and these things were all in the relationship with each other on .
i do n't exactly , if i have time , you very different environments to show .
there 's what that much <unk> .
i 'd like straight one of <unk> pieces of noah , and this is from an early prototype of <unk> , we first came in summer 've been working to you to show , what i think that there 's really the <unk> behind this technology , the <unk> , and this is not so obvious , if you the environments at that we on the website .
we had to us because of the lawyers , care .
this is a <unk> the cathedral <unk> lady , the only in computers with images from flickr <unk> . give you just <unk> lady in flickr and they 're taking pictures of men in t-shirts and on the <unk> , , each of <unk> <unk> represents a picture , this as opposed to this model <unk> discovered .
so these are all <unk> , and they 're standing in in this way in the relationship with each other .
and we can look at these very simple way to navigate .
and you know , i never thought that i finally at microsoft 're going .
i 'm very grateful for the <unk> here .
and i suspect , you can see that many different types of cameras are : everything is , from the <unk> to professional <unk> , a very large number of you that everyone in this environment <unk> .
and as possible , i 'm going some of the strange .
a lot of you 've gone from their faces with etc .
anywhere there 's a number of photography -- there are you .
this is actually a poster of <unk> lady , the right recorded .
we can of the poster to a physical about this environment change .
the point is that we do things with the social environment where do . there are now data from all of -- from the collective stores of the way , visually the earth like -- and everything will are connected .
all these photographs are are connected and it 's something that it 's when the sum of parts .
they get a model that from all over the earth arises .
look at this as the sequel to work , stephen <unk> to <unk> earth .
and this is something that through the complexity , with the people are we use it grows and its use to the user to the application bigger and will .
their own photos are going to <unk> <unk> , another person <unk> .
if someone who have trouble did and all the sacred <unk> , and <unk> , who they 're all , my picture of the <unk> <unk> suddenly with all these data <unk> and i can you a place to use to go into this space to come , in this <unk> , the photos of other people use and a kind of <unk> <unk> social experience with the use of other <unk> .
and of the byproduct of which are the <unk> the virtual models of every interesting part of earth , not just by <unk> or a satellite and get , but through collective storage .
thank you .
and i want you right ? their software is that a certain point , within the next few years , all the pictures that from someone in the world together be used the other associated ?
yes , they do anything else to discover .
if you want to have made it <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of content in the images .
and this is really exciting , if you to a lot of <unk> information to think that many of these images have .
as if you a <unk> for the images to , where they sentences <unk> and the lyrics the website contains a lot of information about the picture that 's .
but how about it when the image you with all its images associated ?
it 's the of the <unk> <unk> and a , it does , really , it 's a classical <unk> .
<unk> , this is really incredible . thank congratulations .
you very much .
i 'm going to share some things from my book about the , as i hope , in unison with other things are you already have heard , and i 'll try to a couple of connections to create , if you have n't have noticed .
i want to start , what i `` <unk> <unk> '' call .
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all of western industrialized societies .
the official <unk> the way , if our goal is to maximize the <unk> our own citizens , is this , through the <unk> the freedom of individuals .
the cause of this is that freedom to itself is good , valuable to make sense , a <unk> requirement for the human .
when people freedom , is on each of us for itself around the things to do that our <unk> maximize and nobody has to us to decide .
the way of freedom to maximize that choice to maximize .
the more choices people have , the more to have you , and the more and they have , the more <unk> have you .
this is , i think so deep in our water <unk> that there 's not in the sense , it would be able to challenge .
and it 's also deeply into our lives rooted in .
i 'm going to share some examples to give , which gives us modern , gives us .
this is my supermarket . no big .
so i just briefly about <unk> say .
there 's 175 <unk> in the supermarket , if you the 10 different extra <unk> n't <unk> and 12 <unk> that they buy could talk about a large number of your lettuce <unk> make the <unk> case that none of 175 in the store to you right .
so this is , like the supermarket .
and then you go to the <unk> business of <unk> <unk> -- speakers , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , <unk> , and in this one of electronics in there 's so many <unk> installations .
we can <unk> millions of different <unk> 'd put out of the components that in a business offered .
you must admit that this is a large variety .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
it was a time , when i was a boy , there was one of the vendor have to you wanted , as he , ma bell .
they have your phone <unk> . you have n't it <unk>
a result of was that the phone ever broken .
these days are over .
we 're almost an infinite variety of phones , especially in the mobile phones .
these are the mobile the future .
my favorite is the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and they should it till now have n't in your business have seen , you can be sure that they soon .
and what it does it 's bring people to go into the business to walk and this question to imagine .
you know now what the answer to the question is ?
the answer is `` no . ''
it 's not possible a phone to buy that not too much .
in other aspects of life that very much <unk> than that get rid of objects , meets the same explosion of <unk> too .
health -- it 's no longer the case in the united states that they went to the doctor and the doctor says you what to do is .
so you go to the doctor and the doctor 's telling them , we were able to make or we could b .
and has the benefits and risks .
b , the benefits and risks . what do you do ?
and they say , `` doctor , what do i do ? ''
the doctor says , a has the benefits and risks and b , those benefits and risks .
what do you do ?
and if you say , `` if you i would be a doctor , what would you do ? ''
the doctor , but i 'm not you . ''
the result is -- we call it `` patient autonomy . it sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift the burden of responsibility for the meeting of people from someone who 's something you know -- namely the doctor -- to someone who did n't know , and likely sick , and not in the best <unk> is a decision to make -- namely the patient .
there 's a tremendous marketing for <unk> drug for people like you and me , that , and if you think , actually make sense , because we do n't buy .
why advertise all around us , if we do n't buy ?

something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide show .
we <unk> not an identity , we make them .
and we make us as a new way we want .
that means that every day , if you the morning up , they decide to , what a kind of person to be like .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time , in the <unk> was that almost every one , and that you so fast got married , as you could , and then as fast , to get out how they could .
the only real choice , `` who , not going , and not what you after doing .
nowadays everything is just too .
i <unk> wonderful intelligent students , and i 'll give you 20 percent less work when i used to do .
and not because they are smart , and not because they are very carefully .
it 's because they do with other things about , you ask yourself , `` do i get married , or not ? should i going to marry ?
do i later to marry ? should i just have kids , or just to do ? ''
they 're all <unk> questions .
and they 're going to ask questions regardless of that if that means of tasks to do that i 'm going to <unk> and a bad grade in my class of wars .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we are blessed , as carl that has , with the technology that gives a minute of every day from any place on the planet to work -- until the <unk> hotel .
there are actually a corner of i do n't tell me , in the <unk> works .
i 'm going to do n't tell , because i use .
so what it , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of choices to meet , and again and again , whether we work better or not work .
we can make our kids on the football games <unk> , and we have our mobile phone at the hip , and our blackberry , the hip , and our laptop and on your lap .
and even if you all off , every minute , we our child in <unk> one <unk> <unk> we ask ourselves too , `` i should take this call it ?
i should it 's an answer ? should i had this letter writing ? ''
and even when the answer to the question `` no , '' is it 's certainly your experience of <unk> of your child <unk> very different than it has been .
everywhere , where we look , big things , things that material stuff and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in the we lived on this .
so i want to say , there are choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in the we live looks like this .
and the question is that are the good or bad news ?
the answer is `` yes .
we all know what good thing is , so i 'm about how bad thing is .
all these <unk> have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effect , <unk> way , is that he <unk> instead of free .
with so many options out of you choose , it 's very hard to look at all to decide .
i 'm going to another one <unk> example to give , a study about investing in volunteers <unk> .
a colleague of me had access to <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million staff , you ca : in different <unk> .
and what they found was a 10 <unk> the employer <unk> , took the part about two percent .
you 're 50 <unk> on -- 10 percent less employees are taking part of as if you just to offer . why ?
because it 50 <unk> are capable of the selection , it 's so hard to decide what you choose to you to it on the morning <unk> .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow 's coming out of course .
now do that this is not just means that people <unk> food , if you go to retire , because they 're not enough money for <unk> , it also means that make a so hard is you very <unk> her employer to miss .
and not part of them up to 5,000 u.s. dollars per year on the <unk> , the happy to be your contribution to <unk> .
paralysis is a lot of too many choices .
and i think it makes that the world looks like this .
they want to the decision really , if it for all eternity , right ?
they do n't want to the investment <unk> vote , or at the wrong <unk> .
so that 's an effect . the other side effect is that even if we think of paralysis get over and a to make the end we are satisfied with the result of choices , when , if we have had to the less ways to decide .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is <unk> through the large variety different <unk> , if you buy , and it 's not perfect -- and that <unk> 's been perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they have another decision would meet , the better to be , and what happens is this <unk> <unk> alternative leads to the decision regret , and regret with negative impact on the average happiness that you from their <unk> decision , as well , if it a good choice .
the more opportunities there , the simple , it 's really nothing to regret that 's disappointing for the choice that they meet .
secondly , what economists <unk> .
dan gilbert 's a point in this morning made by he told me how much the kind of the things are , it depends on to what we compare .
well , if it 's lots of alternative to remember , it 's easy to <unk> features to imagine the alternatives , which they exclude that makes you are satisfied with the alternatives , which they 're elected .
here 's an example , for the of them , no new yorker , apologize for me .
but here is what they 're thinking .
here 's a couple of the <unk> .
very expensive <unk> .
gorgeous beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? `` damn well , the man who thinks , `` it 's in august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood 's gone .
i could directly on my home park . ''
and he spend two weeks of the idea being that he to miss that day of day , a great parking lot .
<unk> reduce the average happiness that we 've gone through our natural selection , as well , if that what we chose were fantastic .
and the more opportunities in the selection is , the more <unk> properties of these choices are in the <unk> account .
here 's another example .
now , this cartoon is doing some statements .
he makes a statement about the going to live and may also about things start to do .
but an important point that he does is , and if you look for one thing to decide , you decide to other things not to do .
and these other things like many <unk> properties , and it will , what they 're going to <unk> .
three : <unk> the expectations .
this was hit , when i was my jeans exchange .
i 'm jeans , almost all the time .
and it was a time in it just jeans a way , and they went out , and you feel bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and when you long enough worn and often enough <unk> had , they started , `` okay . <unk> .
so it was about new jeans to buy after many years of <unk> the old , and i said , `` i 'd like a few jeans , here 's the size . ''
and the sales , `` do you <unk> , slightly <unk> or a vast ?
they want buttons or <unk> , rock or acid <unk> ?
they want jeans with holes ?
would you down , cut , <unk> , blah blah blah ... '' and told him .
my jaw was down and after i rebounding , i said , `` i 'd like to the way that used to the only way . ''
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour for all these <unk> jeans <unk> , and <unk> the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best <unk> jeans , i ever had .
i did it better . all these choices made it , it better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try it myself .
the reason that i got felt was , with all this available ways to my expectations of what a good few jeans is , went up .
i was very low expectations . i had no particular expectations , when they 're just in a way .
when you in 100 kinds of the damn , one of you have a perfect to be .
and what i was good , but it was n't perfect .
and as compared i know what i have had to what i expected , and what i was disappointing in comparison to what i expected .
this add of opportunities in the lives of people increases necessarily the expectations people have about how good at these opportunities are going to .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even if the good .
nobody in the world of <unk> do this , because if you do it would you know they all know what it here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used everything that was more than anything worse , than anything worse , it was for the people to experience to make it 's a surprise .
today , in the world in the we live -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , perfection as an expectation of the best for that you ever hope it 's the things as well , you how it of you expect .
you 'll never it 's , because their hopes , my expectations , <unk> .
the secret to <unk> -- that is what they all come are -- the secret to <unk> are low expectations .
i 'd say -- a short <unk> moment -- i built with a woman married , and she 's really wonderful .
i would n't it better can do . i do n't <unk> .
but <unk> is not always like a bad thing .
finally , a result of <unk> a bad <unk> jeans if it just one way to buy there is that if you <unk> , and you ask why , who are responsible for is the answer right , the world is responsible . what would you can do ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans available , and they buy one that disappointing is , and you ask why , who is responsible for ?
it 's also realized that the answer to the question is , you .
they would it can do .
with a different types of jeans in <unk> that 's no excuse for error .
and so , when people make , and even when the results of making good , feel you disappointed about , and then itself .
clinical depression <unk> in the industrial world in the past generation .
i think about a <unk> -- not the only , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people to have the disappointing , because their standards as high , and then , if you look at these experiences himself explain to , think it would be your fault .
and that 's <unk> that it 's generally better , objective , and we got them .
so let me you remember .
this is the official <unk> , this one that we all the right , completely wrong . it 's not true .
there are no question that a selection is better than no , but it 's not that more selection is better than a selection .
there 's a magical lot . i do n't know what it is .
i 'm pretty sure that we do that long missed , the variety of our <unk> improved .
now , as a <unk> question -- i am almost done -- as a <unk> question that thing about the thinking , the what all these choices to the industrialized societies , is the material that wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we have of many of you heard of the problem is not the large variety .
your problem is you too much .
so the things that i 'm talking about is an odd problem of modern , rich , of societies .
and what 's as frustrating and <unk> is , steve <unk> has to yesterday about it tells how this very expensive and hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a waste of money .
what i 'm going to tell is that expensive , complicated making -- it 's not just that you do n't help .
they 're actually hurt .
you care for that we got there are .
if something of what the people our society is the decisions to meet the societies in which people to a variety of <unk> , would not just the lives of people up , but we would also improved .
economists call this one <unk> <unk> .
<unk> going to worry that it 's better go -- not just the poor country -- because all these large variety of us <unk> .
finally , read you get this cartoon , and , a <unk> person , says , `` ah ! what do this fish ?
you know it possible in this <unk> . ''
<unk> fantasy , a <unk> view of the world -- and that 's the way as i first was reading .
the more i but thinking about , the more i came to the view , that the fish to know .
because the truth is that if you <unk> break , so that everything is possible , they do n't freedom . you have paralysis .
if you <unk> break , so that everything is possible to reduce the average happiness .
you increase the paralysis and reduce the average happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost with <unk> security to be limited -- possibly also for the fish , definitely for us .
but that <unk> be a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for misery , and i guess is a catastrophe .
thank you very much .
you know , i 've talked about some of these are already been talking about the human genome and what i mean , and over the discovery of new groups of genes .
actually start using a new point , we have the biology <unk> and now we 're the digital code in a new phase of biology to get in new life make and build .
we 've always trying to great question to imagine .
what 's life ? it 's something , what i think that many biologists to have to understand and this in different levels .
we have different <unk> trying to put it up on the <unk> components to be easier .
we have almost 20 years <unk> , when we <unk> sequenced have <unk> the transition from the <unk> world of biology to the digital world the computer .
now we try to ask , whether we live regenerate , or whether we new life make , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> the smallest genome of a species has to yourself in the replicate , and we 've tried to see if we 're going to even smaller genome achieve .
we managed to be about a hundred genes to <unk> of the 500 , who are .
but if we those metabolic look at the very simple , in comparison to our , trust me , this is simple . but if we all those genes at the one after the other eliminate can it 's very unlikely that 's a living cell to lead .
so we decided that there 's the only way to go forward is that chromosome in order to <unk> what we allow the components to <unk> and some of fundamental question to imagine .
and so we started to start with the question , we can be a chromosome <unk> ?
gives it the chemistry this really big molecules to what have never before was done ?
and , if we can , we can see the chromosome start ?
a chromosome is so by just a piece <unk> chemical materials .
so the steps in the <unk> of life were exponentially .
our ability of genetic code to write a very slowly , but increased , and our final point was going on an exponential curve .
we talked about 15 years to start .
it actually a few years starting with a <unk> review before we have the first experiments did .
it turns out is <unk> very difficult .
there are tens of machines around the world that little pieces of dna to be able to 30 to 50 of all but it 's a <unk> process , so the longer you a piece of power , more 'll happen .
so we had a new way up with the we have these little pieces together and error correct .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x <unk> .
it 's a virus that bacteria that kills .
we <unk> little pieces , did a <unk> and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase , and this piece of <unk> chemical , and in a bacterium , and the bacteria , the genetic code to read and made <unk> particles .
it 's particles , then the cells <unk> and came back and kill e. <unk> .
recently , i looked at the <unk> talking and they said that they this model that <unk> .
they were more than you here .
so we think that this is a situation is in the software , in the your hardware can build in a biological systems .
but we wanted to be much further , we wanted a whole <unk> chromosome . it has more than <unk> of genetic code . so we thought , we build it in <unk> of the size of the virus what we the size of <unk> <unk> able to understand what the components of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you with digital information in the computer start to have these digital is really <unk> .
and the genome for in sequence , was the <unk> in a mistake per 10,000 pairs .
we found in <unk> and error , if we <unk> sequence is if it would never been <unk> .
so part of design is to pieces to create the 50 percent of long , and in other <unk> pieces <unk> need to get smaller <unk> to do with these <unk> .
we have a elements is built .
you may have heard that we <unk> built .
think about it , we have a <unk> code , a , c , g and t .
<unk> of letters -- these letters <unk> about 20 amino acids , and there 's a single <unk> for each of amino acids .
so we can see the genetic code using about our words to sentences , thoughts .
initially , we just signed .
some people were very disappointed there was no poetry was .
we have the pieces that for that we 're going to <unk> break . there are enzymes are going to repair and again <unk> .
and we started pieces to create , starting with pieces of the <unk> to <unk> letters <unk> , added to this line to <unk> to do about this again <unk> , to <unk> .
in every step , we have these pieces of the surplus produced by we 're going to sequence of , because we were a very <unk> process to create whatever they 're in a minute 'll see .
we tried to the point of <unk> get to .
so , that looks like a <unk> .
if we 're going to these really big pieces get -- with over 100,000 <unk> -- then are these are not just in e. <unk> grow . it exceeds all possibilities of modern molecular biology , and went we 're going to mechanisms to .
we knew from a mechanism of <unk> <unk> called is that the biology is used to the dna to fix that these pieces <unk> .
here 's an example , there 's an organism , <unk> <unk> the three million wheel , radiation <unk> .
you see in the field that his chromosome , apart drops .
12 , 24 hours later , all over and so <unk> how it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do .
these organisms are totally <unk> , you can even in a vacuum .
i 'm really sure that live in space exist , can move , on the search for <unk> conditions .
indeed , the nasa has shown that it 's a lot of them out there are .
here 's a <unk> of the molecule that we made , and this process , have -- in fact , we just <unk> used to the right design the pieces , we 're <unk> . yeast adds and then automatically .
this is not <unk> it 's a <unk> <unk> .
so it 's a big molecule that we even with the <unk> can see .
so , these images about one last of six seconds .
this is the <unk> that we just recently finished asked .
these are about <unk> letters to <unk> ; it 's the largest molecule , <unk> structure that any of people who created .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we do with a <unk> of 10 and without <unk> print , it would <unk> pages <unk> , just about this genetic code <unk> .
now , how to let 's a chromosome out how to activate it ?
obviously this is that it with a virus very simple . it 's more with bacteria deal .
it 's as much easier if you in <unk> as we 're doing , you just the <unk> out and there 's a different inside , and that is that 's exactly what they all over the cloning .
in <unk> is the chromosome into the cell has but just recently we have shown that you have a total transplant of a chromosome from one cell to the other do , and using it .
we <unk> the chromosome one <unk> , roughly , are these two as far apart from how people and mice , we gave some <unk> and so we see that chromosome pick . we <unk> it with <unk> about all the proteins the , and it was very amazing and it in a cell , -- and they 're going to our very <unk> <unk> this value .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
and we thought that 's the end , but we tried the process is going to .
this is the <unk> of evolution .
we find all kinds of species here 's a second chromosome in fact , or a third of <unk> , every time thousands <unk> in just a second to a species <unk> .
people so that evolution of as a gene that a moment changed will have a lot of biology missed .
there are enzymes are <unk> be called the fact dna digest .
the chromosome , in the cell was , none of the chromosomes , we <unk> have been .
it was in the cell <unk> and i realized the chromosome , in the <unk> it and so we had the only a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> the blue because of the genes that we <unk> .
and after a very short time , it all the characteristics of species in and <unk> fully into a new species on the new software that we in the cell given .
all the proteins <unk> the membranes <unk> to -- and the genetic code read , it was that 's exactly what we <unk> .
it may the genomic <unk> , but we can , and by the <unk> shift , things quite dramatic change .
now i argues that this is not the <unk> is -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution
and i argues that we have this is a new form of the cambrian explosion to create in this massive new <unk> based on the digital design could be .
why we should do ?
i think it 's pretty clearly in terms of what we need .
we 're in terms of six to nine billion people in the next 40 years <unk> .
so in my connection to ask : i was in 1946 born .
today are three people on the planet for each of in 1946 does it ; within about 40 years , it four .
we have problems with food , with <unk> and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it 's a challenge that for nine offer .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion <unk> oil . that 's a hundred million <unk> a day .
if we think of biological processes to think , or some process and to replace , it 's a huge challenge .
then , there 's the co2 from this material that in the atmosphere ends up .
we 've now , from our discoveries of the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that the <unk> the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and look at the diversity of that emerged .
we are here in the first line of the limits of biological reality and of those of our idea .
we have today are based on this rapid <unk> , to do that what we <unk> genetics .
we have to a robot to build the millions of chromosomes a day make it .
if you imagine those 20 million various genes that make or this way to optimize the <unk> make or a new vaccines , we can deal with a just a small team of molecular biology , as the last 20 years of science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we can go <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> .
this is a shot of <unk> <unk> , we work , with the you actually sit down and new species on computers are <unk>
you know , we do n't exactly how it will look , we know exactly how their genetic code will look .
we focus on us now on <unk> the fourth generation .
they have recently corn to run ethanol seen what 's just a bad experiment .
we have <unk> the <unk> and third generation of relatively soon out of the very much higher <unk> have to be like <unk> or different types of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way to it is a big impact without any other increase the cost of food or a limitation of the availability , it is if we co2 as <unk> see , and we 're looking at cells that this way ,
and we think that we were the first with <unk> the fourth generation will be , and that in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 is a way .
-- but in our discovery of the world , we all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism that we 1996 described .
he lives in the sea , about <unk> miles deep , almost <unk> <unk> .
it converts co2 in methane and the use of hydrogen and <unk> .
we look at whether we <unk> co2 use , which simply too <unk> to be could , <unk> the co2 in fuel , to this process power .
within a short time we think , we could be able to be one of basic questions of life to solve .
you know , we 've really -- <unk> goals of the <unk> the <unk> industry . right , if you ca n't look at ted i could do , where else ? a <unk> the energy .
but as we 're currently , the same <unk> for the development of <unk> to use .
they have this year with the flu , we 're always a year back off and have a dollar a little bit , if it around the right <unk> .
i think that changed can be showing you <unk> vaccines , <unk> .
that 's like the future might look , with changes , can now the <unk> up to deal with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> .
we 're light years away from people . our goal is it just that we have a chance to have long enough to survive to have to do . thank you .
so on the last ted conference , i have an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come to them to explain how the machine works .

his job is to the conditions to create that are less than a <unk> at the beginning of the universe <unk> -- and it up to 600 million times within a second .
it 's just <unk> <unk> .
this is the machine below in geneva .
we 're taking pictures of <unk> in detectors on .
that i . he 's called <unk> detector , at 44 feet in the height , 22 feet in diameter .
so here <unk> picture of <unk> in the construction and the <unk> .
the 10 . september last year was the machine the first time .
and this picture was from <unk> .
it was <unk> <unk> in control .
it 's a picture of the first <unk> which the way around the lhc <unk> , to deal with a part of the lhc <unk> , to rain from particles in the detector <unk> .
in other words , and this picture of 10 . september saw , we knew that the machine works , what a big triumph .
i do n't know if that the <unk> that , right now , when someone who google side , and the front , we found .
it means that we have a cultural the next to the scientific <unk> .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that with these <unk> here to do was -- this golden wires here .
those wires run <unk> <unk> when the machine , <unk> walking .
now , the engineers of you 're looking at and say , `` no that they do n't . these are small wires . ''
you can actually afford , because if you very far <unk> , you to call <unk> .
at minus <unk> degrees , colder than the space between the stars , those wires the tension <unk> .
in the connections , between the <unk> magnet inside the lhc , there was an <unk> .
so <unk> the wires slightly and <unk> <unk> <unk> suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , it 's <unk> if you imagine that the magnet about 20 tons weigh , to talk about , 30 inches <unk> .
we <unk> so about 50 percent of the magnet
and had to them away , what we also doing .
we <unk> they brand new , <unk> you .
they 're now all over again on their way back .
against the march , the lhc , <unk> .
we 're going to turn , and expect to the data in june , july in , and put our journey continues to figure out what the building blocks of the universe .
well , in a way <unk> those accidents , the debate about the value of science and <unk> in such boundary . it 's easy , that <unk> .
i think that it so hard , the fact that we think about our borders , grab , is the value of things like the lhc .
i mean <unk> words in english scientist left . <unk> <unk> , the , as i suspect , when he the <unk> of his <unk> <unk> to be <unk> was michael <unk> , and said , there 's dangerous for the development of human mind to assume that our scientific ideas <unk> is that there 's no mysteries in nature is that our <unk> <unk> , and that it 's no new worlds to <unk> there . ''
thank you .
i 'm a writer .
books to write is my profession , but it 's kind of course , more than that .
it 's my big , life , and fascination .
and i expect not that , that the change .
however , a recent something <unk> in my life and my career happen to me to , my reference to this work , to rethink .

the result is that i , no matter where i come to be treated , as if i did the <unk> <unk> .
seriously -- the <unk> <unk> .
so , you very concerned to me and say , fear it does n't that they 're going to succeed never <unk> ?
they 're not afraid of that they 're all their lives <unk> and never again a book , that anybody in the world interested , would never again ? ''
okay , that 's really courage .
it is worse , if i don’t remember , that i was about 20 years ago , when i was a teenager the first time i told that i writer , wanted , with the same kind of <unk> we faced by am .
so people said , <unk> you 're not afraid , never succeed ?
you have not afraid that you the humiliation of <unk> <unk> ?
you have not afraid you to this <unk> your entire life <unk> and not something , and you were on a <unk> <unk> dreams are going to -- your mouth filled with the <unk> ashes of failure ? ''
so roughly , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , <unk>
yes , i fear of all these things .
and i had always .
and i even more of fear that nobody <unk> .
and algae problem -- and other <unk> things .
but if it about writing , i 've been recently about it and ask me , why ?
it 's <unk> ?
it 's logical that from someone would be that he was before , the work to do to the it professions feel ?
and what about the creative <unk> out that 's not talking about one <unk> do -- in a way that there are other professions n't do ?
my father , was a chemist , and i can look at me a situation in his 40 years as a chemist remember , he was asked , if he was , chemist .
with your <unk> , john -- what 's telling you ?
it was just not , you know ?
but about fair to be -- the group of a chemist , about the centuries of the reputation of <unk> <unk> people .
we writer seem but this kind of your reputation . but not just the writer , but the creative of <unk> , seem to call , mentally hugely unstable .
everything that they need to do , is the <unk> <unk> of really great minds in the 20th century . century to watch the young and a lot of my hand died .
and even the ones who do n't actually <unk> <unk> that tracks from their talent really neglected been .
norman <unk> said about his death in his last interview , <unk> my books i was a bit further <unk>
an extraordinary thing that you about their <unk> can do .
but we <unk> n't even if we want one that you hear , because we do this kind of statements for as long time know , somehow we have the notion that <unk> and collective accepted that creativity and i 'm sort of course <unk> and that art -- the bottom -- and the <unk> .
the question that i want everyone here i want is , is this idea for them all in all right ?
do you to be ? because with one inch distance at -- i feel with this notion not comfortable .
i think they <unk> .
and i think they 're dangerous . and i do n't see , the next century taken .
i think it better , if we of creative like to live .
and i know definitely , it for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , begin to this dark path of <unk> sort <unk> -- especially in the fact , where i in my career working on 'm on .
that is -- you see , i 'm very young , i 'm just ca n't want to 40 years old .
i may yet another 40 <unk> in me .
and it 's extremely likely that everything , what i from now to write 'm from the world as the work <unk> is that after the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i say it <unk> , because we 're here right now all of friends -- it 's extremely likely that my greatest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that somebody to be able to nine o'clock in begin to <unk> to drink , and that i do n't .
i would prefer to keep this work to do that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of <unk> seems to that i had to continue to write , a kind of <unk> psychological <unk> design .
somehow i have to go from now to find a way , to write a safe distance to be true between me and my very natural <unk> about the response to the <unk> will be .
as i 'm in the past year after models for looking , to do that , i also in the looking and i 've tried to other societies to find to see , if you might have better or <unk> ideas about how did when we how to creative can help , with the emotional risks deal , and creativity connected .
this quest led me into the old greece and the old rome .
please join me , because the circle is going to be close .
but in ancient greece and rome have the people do n't believe that creativity of people , okay ?
they believed that creativity of <unk> <unk> was , from a distant , unknown source of the people coming -- from <unk> , unknown .
the greeks called the divine <unk> of creativity <unk> .
of <unk> is known that he was believed that he had a <unk> that allows him wisdom of further away telling .
the <unk> had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative spirit of <unk> .
that 's amazing . the <unk> was n't really that a genius a particularly <unk> individual .
they believed that a genius this magical <unk> beings , of thought was that there 's literally in the walls of <unk> lives -- like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artists in the work in invisible <unk> and the result of work of design .
it 's brilliant , there is it , there 's the distance , from the i talked about -- the psychological <unk> that you from the following your work protect .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artists of <unk> was a certain things done , like , too much <unk> , right ?
if your work brilliant was <unk> do n't you all look for you <unk> . everybody knew that you this <unk> genius it , that you have helped .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was something <unk> .
so , the people in the really long time , creativity thought .
and then came the renaissance and everything changed , we had this big idea , and these big idea was , let 's the human individual the center of the universe -- -- about all the gods , and the mysteries , and there 's not the more for <unk> creatures that commands by the divine assume .
it 's the beginning of the rational humanism , and the people started to believe that creativity has completely off their own individual .
the first time in history you people , or those artists a genius call -- instead of that he 's a genius .
i have to say , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , a <unk> person to allow that he thinks that he or she 's like this <unk> what that see and the essence , and the source of divinity , creative , <unk> , an infinite <unk> is a little bit too much responsibility to a <unk> , human psyche <unk> .
it 's like someone to ask , the sun comes to swallow .
this <unk> and <unk> whole egos , and it 's all these <unk> expectations of success .
i think that this <unk> our artists of the last 500 years <unk> .
and , if this is that -- and i think it 's true -- is the question :
can we change ?
maybe a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and the mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe , we can <unk> from 500 years rational humanism not just in a <unk> talk <unk> .
and there 's certainly people in this audience that really <unk> scientific doubt <unk> would go over the idea of -- basically -- <unk> that people <unk> and <unk> on their projects , use .
i 'll probably not all of them on this journey to take .
but the question that i <unk> want is : why not ?
why not so think about ?
because it 's just as much sense of anything else that i heard , if it 's why did that are absolutely crazy <unk> <unk> of creative process .
a process that 's -- like everybody knows that it ever tried to have to make -- so in other words , actually , everyone here -- not always <unk> behave .
in fact , he can look at times literally <unk> feel .
i had recently of close as i was the extraordinary the poet <unk> stone , that all over 90 is , but all their entire life poet , when they told me that you when you in <unk> virginia up out on the fields worked . she said , they would feel and can hear how a poem written about the landscape on them <unk> .
she said it would like a <unk> move from the air ,
and over the land on them <unk> .
they felt , if it came , because it would the globe in their feet , <unk> .
they knew that they were in such as just one could do , and this was -- in their words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they ran out how the devil in the house while you from that you are , it was only thing that they soon enough to one of paper and a pencil get to that they could it when it by making them <unk> to capture and on the sheet of it could .
in other paint it was not fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but they reached the house , and that you would roll , they them and they <unk> it . she said it was going on the country , and -- how they said -- <unk> a different poet <unk> .
and then there these moments -- the part i 'll never forget -- she said that there are moments , where it almost <unk> .
so , she runs the house and is looking for the paper and the poem goes through them them and she grabs a pencil just as it through them <unk> and then -- she said -- it was such as was going to other hand , grab and it into wars .
they <unk> the poem to tail and moved it back in their bodies and took it on the of paper .
at these opportunities to the poem <unk> and intact on the paper on -- but backwards -- the last word for the first .
when i heard i thought this is incredibly -- this is exactly how to my creative process <unk>
this is not like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel .
i 'm a <unk> . to work to be able to me every day at the up and <unk> to me <unk> and very awkward <unk> .
but even in my <unk> , sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess that a lot of you that we 've done .
so i had to work or ideas , from a source of me <unk> that i do n't identify .
what is that for a thing ?
and how we 're doing in the relationship with about our minds to lose . it 's the even in <unk> health of ?
for me is the living , how to this to be the musician and <unk> . i could give him a few years for a magazine interview .
we talked about to talk about this topic , and you know what ? of the time of his life was tom the embodiment of <unk> modern artist , trying to <unk> creative <unk> that in him <unk> , to control and with you <unk> .
but then he was older and <unk> . he told me that he 's one day on a <unk> in los angeles out , and changed , everything for him .
he went with high speed as it all of a little <unk> a tune hear that , as it at <unk> often , for him <unk> a tangible , and he wants you . it 's <unk> . he <unk> then , but he ca n't you believe .
he did n't of paper , he did n't have a pen , he did n't <unk> .
he starts so , those old <unk> in him <unk> , like , `` i 'm going to this thing to lose and i 'm from this song on forever tracked .
i 'm not good enough , i create it <unk>
but instead of panic to get , he just on .
he ended the <unk> and doing something completely new .
he looked up in the sky , and he <unk> , can you ca n't see that i had to ride ? ''
<unk> i like when i could just a song <unk> ?
if you really exist want to come to a <unk> moment , when i want to you care .
if not , <unk> today someone else .
go and <unk> leonard <unk>
his whole <unk> , after that changed .
not the work , who was still a lot of dark matter how <unk> and the .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that it is that was <unk> when he 's genius from out it took , where he 's nothing to stay out of the and then <unk> where he sort came from . he realized that there 's not <unk> , <unk> thing to be .
it was a <unk> , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a conversation , tom and the <unk> , <unk> thing that , and was .
so this story that we have changed it also a bit of the way that i worked and it was already have saved .
this idea saved me when i went out in <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , when i fell in one of <unk> of <unk> in the we all the fall , if we looked at some work and it does n't . you <unk> to think that there 's a disaster . this is the worst book , that ever been .
not just bad , but the worst of times .
i started to think , i should the project , <unk> .
but then it reminded me , like tom in the in heaven talking , and i tried it .
i took so my view from the manuscript and spoke to comment towards the one of the corner of .
i spoke out loud , <unk> to , you thing , you and i know them , if this book not brilliant is that there 's not completely my fault , right ?
because you see , i do anything that i , <unk> . i have no more than that .
if you so that we want to have to you here <unk> and the percentage of the <unk> <unk> .
okay , but when you do n't do -- you know what , the use it .
i 'm still kept writing , because it 's my job .
and i 'd go to <unk> , that i 'm going to part of jobs here <unk>
because -- -- so at it 's like this , for centuries , in deserts <unk> people to <unk> with the sacred <unk> and music <unk> , for hours from were -- to <unk> .
this fixed were always the great , because the dancer , professional and they were fantastic .
but and again , very rare , was something special . one of <unk> was actually <unk> .
and i know that you know , what i mean , because i know that they all in your life , one of <unk> have seen .
it 's when you 'd be the time <unk> and the dancer from a kind of <unk> occur . he did n't help but when he 's ever done it -- on nights ago , but all to put them together .
and very suddenly appeared he 's no longer in human .
he was from <unk> and from the <unk> and everything <unk> to go through a <unk> fire .
as something that happened , did the people what that was , they called it at his name .
they put the hands together and began to sing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , <unk>
this is god , you know ?
interesting historical <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> <unk> brought them to do with . the <unk> changed in the centuries of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that you still in <unk> and <unk> sounds .
if a <unk> in spain , <unk> , something magical done is : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> more , there is it : a <unk> at god .
and that 's amazing , because we need that .
but , the tricky part of the following the next morning when the dancer ourselves up and realize that it was 11 o'clock in a tuesday , and he 's no longer a <unk> from god in this is .
he 's just a <unk> mortal with <unk> <unk> , and maybe he will never come back to these heights <unk> .
and maybe it will never again and god 's behalf of , if it turns out , but what is he then with the rest of his life begin ?
this is hard .
this is one of <unk> <unk> one of creative life .
but maybe it must not quite so full <unk> to be when you from beginning to do n't believe , that the extraordinary aspects of mortality of you come .
if you might just think that you a <unk> are -- from a <unk> of a <unk> time of that look at somebody else 's passed , if you 've done with it .
if we start , about it , it changes all this .
so i started to think and so i think for the past few months , as i 'm working on the book was that about to appear to -- as the most dangerous , <unk> , which i expected <unk> my <unk> success .
what i had always trying to say to , if i think about it drives me , is , was not afraid .
i was n't <unk> .
i 'm just your job .
we continue to your contribution here , which , he would be may .
if your job that dance , dance .
if the dumb divine genius , that you through the asked , decide , for a moment a <unk> by miracles through your effort to show , <unk> ! ''
and if not , dance in the dance .
and <unk> ! '' for you , despite all of .
i think about and i feel that , we should be the teaching .
<unk> ! '' for you , despite all of , just for you to the mere human love and the <unk> did , for that there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> .
last year i these slides shown to illustrate that the <unk> <unk> , for nearly three million years of the size of the bottom forty-eight states had to 40 percent <unk> .
but this <unk> not very strong enough to the seriousness , this particular problem , there 's not the thickness of ice is .
in a sense , the <unk> <unk> the <unk> heart of our global <unk> .
they 're in winter and <unk> in summer .
the next slide that i want to show that 's a <unk> what the last 25 years is happening .
this <unk> is the red <unk> .
so you see that 's it on the <unk> <unk> . this is the annual ice in winter , and it <unk> in summer .
this so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which one of the body is <unk> .
in 25 years will it from here it 's gone .
this is a problem , because the global warming the frozen reason for the arctic ocean <unk> , where it large amounts of <unk> carbon , which , when he <unk> , of microbes , methane implemented .
to the amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , could be this huge amount double , if we had this critical to cross .
already today <unk> in some a lakes in alaska methane itself from the water .
professor <unk> walter the university in alaska , with one another group that 's a sea last winter around .
wow !
it 's good . the question is how it 's going to us <unk> .
and one reason is , this enormous <unk> up greenland from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are much bigger than ever .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know , like the sea level of <unk> up here <unk> them into the sea .
these are taking rapidly .
the other end of the planet , the west antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
last month <unk> researchers that the entire continent now a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> , about a few <unk> up , is particularly powerful in the melting .
this to about 20 feet <unk> , as greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see the top of lakes , a few years glacier .
forty percent of people in the world a half of their <unk> from this <unk> .
in the andes , this glacier the <unk> for this town .
the <unk> , <unk> .
but if you <unk> , will also the most of water <unk> .
in california has a 40 <unk> reduction of <unk> the sierra seen .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions , as you read , seriously .
these <unk> in the world leads to a dramatic increase the fire .
and the disaster all over the have in a really <unk> and before never <unk> <unk> up .
four times as many in the last 30 years of the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you see this in a connection to look , you can see what it <unk> .
in the last five years we 70 million tons of co2 produced all of 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
so look at the area of the eastern pacific so , from the continent <unk> and <unk> of indian <unk> , where it 's a <unk> decline of <unk> in the <unk> there .
the largest single factor for the global warming , besides <unk> , 20 percent is that 's the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states are one of two <unk> <unk> , together with china .
and the suggestion , many more <unk> .
but we start to a change .
here are the that in recent years <unk> , with some green alternative that have proposed .
<unk> there 's a political <unk> in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> on to clean coal , <unk> , what to have been a contradiction in this is .
this reminded me of something .
for christmas around walked to me at home in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> .
they have it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country in the <unk> <unk> america .
this happened at christmas .
one of the commercials , <unk> for christmas was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happier -- .
it 's the shell and a in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> , every day , clean .
he 's <unk> and <unk> , and workers stay in <unk> and bread .
this is the source of the most of coal in west virginia .
the most <unk> is the ladder of <unk> coal .
let me a very clear , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they do n't know , what they talk .
so the alliance for <unk> two campaign in called .
this is a lot of a part of her .
the <unk> let 's climate change as a serious risk for our business .
so we have to <unk> <unk> on , a <unk> <unk> spend about a <unk> on the way to bring to the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not <unk> .
we think , she 's clean -- and smells , well .
so , do you do n't worry about the climate change .
let you take us .
<unk> coal , they have a lot of .
so let 's a tour of modern , <unk> <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it 's the sound of <unk> <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal one of the main reasons for the global warming is that were remarkably clean <unk> that you see here , it changes everything .
so it right , this is the today , clean <unk> .
finally mix of the positive alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge the national security .
america 's in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread of these all together , is our dependence of <unk> <unk> the dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there 's a courageous , new way to us from that <unk> able to free .
<unk> america to 100 percent cleaner electricity is , over the next 10 years .
a plan , america back to work , us safer to make and to help , the global warming to stop .
finally , a solution , the large enough , our problems to solve .
<unk> america in new . you find more out .
this is the last .
it 's about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest way , our dependence of old , diapers <unk> that our world <unk> , to reduce .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment , to be paid jobs .
<unk> america in new . it 's time , reality to accept .
it 's an old african <unk> , `` if you 're going to want to go alone .
if you go to want to go together . ''
we have far , and it 's fast .
thank you .
i want to begin to ask , to the time of your childhood <unk> , when you with <unk> played .
as they realized how to the hands <unk> and <unk> that <unk> <unk> and moves , learned that they actually , to think and problems through the understanding and change <unk> <unk> to solve .
this of thinking is closely with connected , as we have a large part of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> <unk> , i started to wonder : what if we know , would that instead of <unk> , who look like a digital <unk> on a a <unk> moves -- -- what if we with both hands intervene could and data , physically take and you <unk> could , as we want ?
this question was so <unk> that we to an exploration of the answer to and <unk> developed .
so , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of <unk> .
you can with the hand moves , you can each of , you can get your movement capture and they have a screen and a <unk> .
more importantly , they are physically , which you like <unk> merely by the reach the hands and access can move .
and the <unk> 're an example of a new generation of <unk> the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools <unk> , and a conscious for your movement , to each other , and the intricacies of our <unk> with you see , then we can of exploration of new and <unk> <unk> start .
i start with a simple examples .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and if i asked him in one direction <unk> , the video forward played back ; if i asked him in the other direction <unk> , what it backwards .
and interactive portraits take it 's true .
if i so next 'm going to <unk> that their interest .
if you <unk> surrounded , notice that , and we can be a little nervous .
and they feel as your movement and propensity .
an interesting a consequence of interactions that we have to realize started to was that we everyday gestures on data to be , like colors that way to go into how to this with <unk> .
in this case we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> and i can you use to paint in the middle of <unk> , where they then mix .
if we <unk> , we can a little <unk> .
there 's also have some nice opportunities in the education , speaking of mathematics or <unk> , where we the people possibility of the rapid <unk> , and the results to see .
here i -- that 's a <unk> that i do with a simple <unk> <unk> .
this is a game with words , that a mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically you get a round to <unk> happen to <unk> letters and while you try to words to form , and over a dictionary <unk> .
then , after about 30 seconds , again <unk> and you have a new <unk> and new ways out .
thank you .
this is some kids who on a the media lab , and i was that to move , it out and have a video of them .
they have it really loved .
an interesting fact , this kind of applications is that you have the people not a lot of instructions must be .
all you say , is `` it words , and you know exactly what to do is .
here are still a few people to this test .
this is our youngest <unk> in the bottom right .
it turns out that he 's the <unk> only if .
so for him they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can create new characters in the scene , and the <unk> the table <unk> , this figure shows .
so let 's the sun <unk> .
the sun goes on

the <unk> <unk> .
good work . yes !
and the <unk> shake and it 's put it can see the characters are now ...
-- his own story invent .
hi !
it 's a story with open up and he can decide , as you .
flying cat .
the last example , to that i time , it to show that 's a <unk> for <unk> that we 've developed , and in the <unk> as sound , like <unk> , bass , and <unk> operate .
and has four different variations ; you can choose , which you use to .
and you can see this sounds in the sequence <unk> that you see again in any patterns <unk> .
and you <unk> it , you just a <unk> to a <unk> hold .
there are effects that you live to change , like the city hall and filters .
you hook it with a sound and tends to then to hire .
and then , <unk> effects of the speed and <unk> that you see on the entire sequence <unk> .
so let 's time .
we start , where we <unk> in two <unk> <unk> and in a series <unk> , you , and a little bit of the voice to add .
now <unk> i got a bass ,
now i 'm still do something <unk> to do .
and now <unk> i the filter the <unk> , so i the effect live taxes .
i can all the sequence speed , by the speed at the one or other direction <unk> .
and now <unk> i the filter , with a bass , for a term .
i can see the sequence when they 're on <unk> .
so i have you 're not in the <unk> plan , but to improvise , and meanwhile <unk> or <unk> .
and finally , i the entire sequence <unk> , i the <unk> to the tend .
thank you .
how you can see , which is my excitement , new <unk> to develop the better to fit , like our brains and bodies .
and today , i had time , you a part of these new <unk> and some of possibilities of to show that we in our lab .
the idea that i 'm going to put on the way to do is that we look at the verge of this new generation of <unk> to interact with digital media , the information in our world , which our needs to about .
thank you .
i 'm on the conversation with you all .
