you know , great <unk> to travel and <unk> , and <unk> of the things together with the people in the skies in the old days , we can see the past , the wind , partly dependent on the rain <unk> <unk> touch it in the <unk> <unk> the taste .

and share the same <unk> .
we all born . we have the world .
we <unk> <unk> .
we need to deal <unk> separation of death <unk> and so it does n't <unk> that we were singing , dance , and art <unk> .
but it 's the unique <unk> the <unk> , the rhythm of <unk> in every culture .
and plays no matter whether it . <unk> in the forests of <unk> , or <unk> in haiti , or the warrior down <unk> of <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> , or a <unk> in africa . this is by a colleague , i have a month in the desert traveled to discuss or a <unk> of the brain <unk> . everest , the <unk> world .
all these people teach us to the other <unk> , some <unk> , some ways to <unk> earth .
and that is that 's what if you think about 19 , and satisfy us .
the form of <unk> cultures all over a net , <unk> and <unk> life the earth <unk> to the earth as a lot of biological <unk> , the biosphere species .
you can this cultural <unk> as a <unk> . <unk> can help the sum of thoughts and dreams , myths , <unk> and <unk> the human imagination , beginnings of <unk> were defined .
the <unk> is a legacy of humanity .
they did this symbol of what do is , and what we as they <unk> species , are .
and just like designing biosphere , <unk> he was this with the <unk> -- with the <unk> speed .
and biologist , for example , to argue about 50 percent more of ways just like an interesting , because it 's , it , -- that <unk> <unk> on the area of that diversity -- we hardly see that as <unk> <unk> on the area of cultural diversity , is .
and the <unk> the reason is an official languages .
one of you in this room was born in the earth <unk> talked about .
now is a language , not <unk> the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is a human mind .
it 's a commitment to the soul certain that access to the material world .
every language is like a <unk> into the mind , a little thought this ecosystem <unk> possibilities .
and of these <unk> languages are today , while we here in monterey sit , exactly half of the ears of kids <unk> .
they <unk> not taught me that means if nothing done , in the world dead .
what could <unk> could be from silence <unk> be a lot of the last <unk> of a lot of your language to talk to have the wisdom holds the <unk> , or the hope to expect ?
and <unk> this terrible is actually , somebody somewhere on earth , you ca n't have two weeks , because of two weeks of dying is an older , and the last <unk> one of language , the tomb .
and i know that some of them , it 's not better ? '' and the world not a better place , if we all just a language to be ? '' and i say : `` well , let 's language <unk> to let me <unk> .
let this kogi . ''
and then they would suddenly realize how it would be your own language n't talk .
so i want to <unk> on a journey through the <unk> take a short journey through the <unk> to try to <unk> to do n't actually losing the .
now there are under us <unk> forget that when i say `` different ways of his chariot 's really different ways of his wife .
you , for this child mortality <unk> the northwest amazon , `` the <unk> think we 're <unk> the <unk> from east , in <unk> of a snakes <unk> .
and that people , which is why <unk> between all the green . , there 's <unk> the rest of the people <unk> , <unk> .
they have a <unk> language and a <unk> the <unk> <unk> called `` you to marry , the other language that .
this all <unk> in the <unk> past . <unk> these big <unk> , because <unk> six or seven languages , things , but that you have never would hear classical period of learning .
you hear them up to begin to talk .
or one <unk> tribes , i 've ever lived in the <unk> in <unk> of <unk> an amazing people , the first in 1958 <unk> <unk> .
the year 1957 to five <unk> my record and made a <unk> mistake .
they looked <unk> photos of of the air down , what we as <unk> <unk> the to help <unk> , you that these people from the rainforest in humans do something <unk> seen .
they raised these photographs from <unk> we tried the face or the character and found nothing to <unk> this is <unk> the devil be able <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
but the <unk> <unk> not just <unk> with the <unk> .
they <unk> other .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> through <unk> .
we <unk> the <unk> eight generations back and found three cases of a natural <unk> and as we people <unk> something about <unk> i gave them out of the same old , and he 's because his age died and we <unk> him still with the <unk> .
but they had . <unk> the <unk> 's an amazing .
and <unk> could be a of years ago <unk> the smell will determine , which <unk> this was .
in the early <unk> years i got a really amazing job , when i my professor at harvard and i 've got interested in a haiti and the secret societies . <unk> the <unk> the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and poison him to use , <unk> to make it was .
whale meat <unk> a sense , i had to something about this remarkable about the <unk> know , <unk> is not <unk> of the magic .
the it 's a complex <unk> <unk> .
it 's interesting .
if you ask yourself , a big <unk> <unk> , what would say ?
christianity , of islam in buddhism , <unk> , .
this continent will always <unk> , <unk> what was it in sub-saharan no , they give birth of , and <unk> and it 's <unk> this <unk> religious people in the tragic <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
but what <unk> so interesting that 's this living relationship between living in the dead .
the living <unk> the spirit .
the spirit can see , the water <unk> , the answers on the rhythm of <unk> the soul living <unk> to <unk> so that the <unk> for a short <unk> moment , god .
<unk> say , <unk> like , `` you have to go into the church and you about god .
and dancing in the temple in terms of god . ''
and because you 're obsessed you do you my mind <unk> . how you damage <unk> ?
you see these amazing <unk> : <unk> in a <unk> the <unk> coal , <unk> <unk> an amazing <unk> the ability to the body size of influence that it <unk> is a state of extremes <unk> <unk> .
well , of all you 've figured out of kogi from the sierra , de . <unk> in <unk> the <unk> .
offspring , <unk> civilization -- <unk> <unk> of colombia <unk> and in as the <unk> moved back into a couple of <unk> <unk> <unk> back in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people the only get away from the <unk> <unk> .
to our economic times , of a <unk> <unk> governed by math education , <unk> but that very extraordinary .
the <unk> be at the three plus four years their families separated and in a <unk> in a <unk> work , <unk> the <unk> the glacier , 18 years <unk> the two periods of each nine years , deliberately elected to nine months for pregnant <unk> in their lap , <unk> was spent to spend so what <unk> their lap , mother .
and during this whole time , culturally and values , as a universal values of the <unk> <unk> , in their <unk> and just <unk> the cosmic -- or we could say that <unk> an equilibrium <unk> .
the bottom of amazing <unk> , and suddenly the taken over time , in your life , at the 18 years , you see a <unk> . and in <unk> social consciousness , <unk> , and starts to the <unk> with an amazing . and they radiate to suddenly everything in abstract learned an amazing <unk> confirms . and the priests , back and says , `` you see ? it 's really like , i told me .
it 's so beautiful . you have to protect . ''
they call the older brothers and say that we 've got a brothers , for the destruction all responsible .
now this level of intuition is important .
and if we 're <unk> the landscape of <unk> we 're either <unk> and that old <unk> the <unk> wild <unk> , which in his <unk> a <unk> thought , or in <unk> and say , these people are more , connected , and .
so , <unk> , nor <unk> one more , they were <unk> <unk> .
it 's not much space for the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or cold <unk> of <unk> , but anyway , through time and <unk> a <unk> <unk> is shaped not on the idea is going to close to be going on a far <unk> intuition is an idea of the earth 's only exist , they 're in human consciousness <unk> .
well , what does it
what it a little kid from the <unk> , that we believe <unk> the mountain , <unk> is , or her destiny determine , and other person , and relationship to this resource in this place , as a little kid from montana , that we believe <unk> i had a bunch stones , <unk> can be .
if he <unk> one , or a bunch <unk> get it 's <unk> .
's a metaphor of relationship between <unk> and , defined .
i grew into the forests of <unk> colombia , believed that these forests , there are the <unk> .
that made me to a other than my friends , <unk> to believe that these forests , <unk> of <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> spirit of the <unk> the world , the spirit of them to <unk> participate .
well , if you see the idea of these cultures , realities of can you some of extraordinary discoveries to understand that these plant here .
it 's a picture , that i just last april the northwest amazon <unk> .
this is <unk> a lot of you have heard of the most <unk> <unk> from the <unk> the <unk> .
what <unk> so fascinating that 's not only <unk> potential for <unk> , but in the it really two different sources , based on the of these <unk> <unk> , which is a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> very easy <unk> , <unk> of these <unk> alone <unk> 's such as a blue <unk> smoke from their minds put it will work with the <unk> one <unk> from the family , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
these plant contains some very strong <unk> the kind of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> like .
if you in the <unk> 've ever see , this stuff <unk> , these <unk> you very different actually contains , <unk> .
this <unk> to <unk> 's about it from a <unk> <unk> to <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it , and reality , but the reality .
i 've even with my professor , richard <unk> <unk> young man , <unk> <unk> with the discovery by the magic mushrooms , in the <unk> years <unk> has about , the art <unk> you have these <unk> do <unk> <unk> was a moment , and steer the impact feel , you do n't there 's the <unk> experience .
but the thing with <unk> is not <unk> <unk> can be , through a couple of gut , <unk> enzyme that name <unk> , <unk> .
you can only connection with some of chemicals <unk> <unk> to the mao <unk> .
now this fascinating is that the <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> the same way we are necessary to get it 's <unk> to <unk> right ? '' itself .
we make these people from a <unk> of <unk> species <unk> of these two <unk> not , plants , you like this way combined , a kind of <unk> version of that the whole than the assembly parts ?
we use these great <unk> 're trying to be used as <unk> turns out .
but if you , you say , `` the plant some of us . ''
so , what does it
this tribe , <unk> the 17th <unk> , <unk> , you all the great distance the hard to our eyes as a appear .
and then ask , when you know , their <unk> <unk> and they say , `` i thought , <unk> something of plants .
i mean , you know , nothing ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns out that every land 17 <unk> , <unk> <unk> and they sing to a in a different <unk> .

well , <unk> problem is n't even those circumstances of sympathy had hard to the indigenous who have a <unk> and <unk> look at , kind of the past <unk> in real world , that our world , <unk> .
so , the fact , this century , in 300 years , for wars or -- innovations remember , but rather than a new era where we <unk> , and the massive destruction , and cultural diversity earth , active supported on passive <unk> . so the problem is not the change .
all cultures , again , dance , <unk> involved .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> heard rather than the sioux in the bow tie <unk> tasks , in the americans <unk> americans who could be dead horse and <unk> tasks .
ca n't change and technology <unk> the integrity of <unk> . it 's power . <unk> face of <unk> .

or if we are mountains of <unk> to go back <unk> much <unk> , you <unk> the political <unk> see .
you know , the genocide is , <unk> an of people will , convicted at all the <unk> the destruction lifestyle who will not just a convicted , but generally and <unk> as part <unk> <unk> .
and you can suffer <unk> n't understand you 're going on <unk> level experienced this .
i have to do with a young and <unk> miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> through <unk> , <unk> and just as i 'm <unk> i saw her face the statistics , you hear . <unk> holy <unk> , <unk> and <unk> into the only 1.2 million people in the cultural , <unk> murdered .

meant he 's the chinese <unk> was killed .
his uncle <unk> . holiness the <unk> be able to nepal , .
his mother was locked up <unk> for -- for crimes <unk> .
he was at the two years ago , in jail <unk> , under your <unk> to hide , because they do n't live .
my sister and <unk> did <unk> a couple of <unk> .
one day in the on the <unk> <unk> and for these <unk> had a seven years , and <unk> <unk> .
that suffering <unk> can <unk> , but the <unk> spirit people 's something <unk> .
and the bottom we are really have a choice . want to come in a <unk> in a <unk> or in a <unk> in a diversity ?
margaret <unk> of the anthropologist , before they died from their greatest fear is a while we 're in a thread , <unk> , <unk> <unk> to do , bandwidth of human imagination , <unk> way to see , but that one day from a dream up to forget it 's the other possibilities .
and it 's <unk> to think it , perhaps been <unk> to exist .
the <unk> revolution , and we got to us in this moment , <unk> the <unk> <unk> of our poetry , <unk> through the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and , <unk> labor surplus , i found was just 10,000 years instead .
the modern industrial world , it 's hardly 300 years old .
now , these <unk> told me that we respond to the challenges that we 're going to <unk> <unk> to stand .
if we <unk> <unk> all of <unk> to respond with 10,000 of voices .
and in this song we going to <unk> , that , what we are some people and consciousness is the importance of that many people who gardens of us thrive and <unk> to be the great moments of the optimism .
here 's a picture , the bottom of the end <unk> <unk> , when i <unk> on the <unk> . and this man , <unk> i told me a wonderful story of <unk> .
the <unk> government is not always work with the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> years , <unk> the <unk> our <unk> , they were forced to live <unk> have .
the grandfather , old man refused .
and the fear of life i took him , guns and all tools .
now you know that the <unk> no fear the cold , they used to your advantage .
the <unk> their <unk> , originally from fish , <unk> <unk> being made .
the grandfather of man <unk> on the arctic , or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> out , and his <unk> from <unk> down and <unk> your hand , and as the <unk> to <unk> and we <unk> he made the shape of <unk> .
he <unk> <unk> on the sides of <unk> and as it , frozen , <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a <unk> took that <unk> the dog and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> other dog , <unk> about the <unk> with the <unk> the <unk> .
so you can do n't do something .
and this is how many ways a symbol for the resistance . <unk> and all indigenous manufacturing world .
the <unk> government of the <unk> in april 1999 , complete control area from the bigger than the severe texas .
it 's our new country , which means <unk> .
it 's a <unk> area . they control all <unk> .
amazing example of the nation , a state of the <unk> with his people , and achieve .
and eventually think it 's pretty obvious , so we 've got to these distant goals , traveled all , they 're going away .
they are the <unk> someone else .
they represent parts of human imagination of the past , <unk> . and for all of us to dream of children have dreams of children of the <unk> of hope .
what we need national <unk> ultimately , is that we think politicians ever happen .
we <unk> -- we <unk> not <unk> , but we <unk> change the world , and so we are probably the institution for <unk> in the world . to get 35 million <unk> every month .
<unk> nations send our <unk> .
and magazines of people reading .
and we do a series of travel into the <unk> to work with our audience to places , when the <unk> take you 're going <unk> <unk> , and hopefully going to the other the revelation of anthropology suppose that this world certainly deserves a very different ways to exist in a <unk> in a very multicultural <unk> world and the collective wisdom of all of our common well-being can
you .

we see , many <unk> the digital photographs here . <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> at any way to <unk> .
and it matter how many , we look how big data <unk> , or how big , are .
most of them , <unk> a camera , but this is , for example , from the <unk> and it 's an area of 300 <unk> .
it does n't because the performance of a system like this <unk> it 's the number <unk> on their screen in every moment . it has also a very <unk> architecture .
this is a whole book , one example <unk> .
that 's <unk> <unk> of <unk> . <unk> is a chapter .
, to prove that it 's a text that 's not a picture is we do something like to do n't really the kind of a real <unk> the <unk> and no image is .
well , this artificial kind of <unk> to read .
i would n't it <unk> .
this is a <unk> case . this is a <unk> of the guardian .
every big image is beginning of the <unk> .
and that you really great pleasure and the good experience a real <unk> a magazine or a newspaper to read about this in the medium with several <unk> .
we have the corner of particular <unk> of the guardian .
we have a false <unk> with very high <unk> designed as much higher than a normal <unk> , and we have extra to the .
if you see features of cars , we 're seeing .
or models , or even technical <unk> .
and this <unk> of these ideas on , these <unk> for the <unk> place on the screen <unk> .
we hope that no <unk> of nonsense which means -- that should n't necessary .
of <unk> , really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i 'm really not much time , except to say that we also to this area of .
but are all roads in the <unk> .
<unk> up on the <unk> from nasa .
let 's something else <unk> .
this is even live on the , but it <unk> .
this is a project , <unk> 's really two different technologies that connects us .
that 's <unk> and the other 's a very good for about <unk> , noah <unk> , an <unk> the university in the advice from steve <unk> the <unk>
and rick <unk> of microsoft , and became a very good working .
so this is live on the it 's <unk> by .

but the <unk> <unk> images is here in the importance .

i 'm not whether the time you create environments .
there are very much <unk> are .
i 'd like <unk> of <unk> <unk> , noah , and that 's the early prototype of <unk> , we first was working with you that do this kind of what i think it really the <unk> behind this technology , the <unk> , and this is not so obvious if you create environments you look over the site .
we had to the lawyers , care .
now this <unk> the cathedral <unk> lady , of the computers with images from flickr <unk> to give you <unk> lady , flickr , and images of men in <unk> and on the <unk> , and each of <unk> <unk> represents a picture of the way to this model <unk> discovered .

and we can on this very simple way navigate .
and you know , i 've never <unk> that i eventually got to work to you .
i 'm very grateful for the <unk> here .
i guess what you can see that this many different types of cameras are : is all of the <unk> to <unk> <unk> , a number one of the environment <unk> .
and if that i 'm some , .
many of them are from <unk> by .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here .
this is actually a poster of <unk> lady , that was recorded .
we can a poster to a physical view of those things .
the point is here we do things with the social environment do we will now data of all collected data on the collective <unk> world , the earth like -- and everything will all .
all these photographs will , and it , something bigger than the sum up .
they get a model , and earth in .
look this as the sequel to work as stephen <unk> , <unk> earth .
and that 's something through the complexity of the people are using bacteria grows and use for the user into the bigger .
your own photos are <unk> <unk> the other person <unk> .

and of <unk> all of the <unk> the virtual models of any interesting part of earth 's not only through <unk> a satellite , and we were going through collective <unk> .
you .
and i was right ? their software is going to a certain time within the next to all images of someone in the world together be used in principle in the network ?
yeah . they did n't than .
if they created a <unk> the images .
and they do this because the <unk> in the images .
and that 's really exciting when they are the world <unk> information terms of these images .
and when you <unk> for images <unk> the sentences <unk> and the text by the site of the information about a picture is .
but like , where you with all these the ?
it 's the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and the work that makes a really enormous . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> it 's really incredible . you congratulations .
you very much .
i 'm some things from my book about this is that i hope in other things are probably already have heard , and i 'm trying to give you connections to create , if you have noticed .
i want to begin , `` <unk> <unk> '' .
that <unk> <unk> of what ?
the <unk> <unk> of all western industrialized societies .

the reason the , the freedom tower , very valuable to make a <unk> <unk> for human .


more to people have the freedom of us , and they have the <unk> have you .
this is , i think , so deep in our water <unk> that it , in the sense , it would be <unk> .
and it 's also , and in our lives <unk> .
i 'm going to give us modern progress . .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just briefly about <unk> say .
there 's 175 <unk> in my supermarket , if the kind of these extra <unk> not <unk> and 12 <unk> , they could take a big number of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> case they 're not by 175 people to do properly .
this is the supermarket .
and then go to <unk> business . <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> the radio , <unk> . and in a <unk> business , so many <unk> <unk> .
we can <unk> million people <unk> <unk> <unk> from the components , which is a business , .
they must admit that that it was the world .
in other areas -- the world of communication .

they have your phone <unk> you have n't it <unk>
it 's in the phone ever broken .
these days are over .
we have now almost a <unk> the your phones , especially in the world of mobile .
are the mobile the future .
my favorite is the in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and you 're not yet in your business have seen , you need to be it soon .
and what it does it brings people get into the business and and this question .
you know now what the answer is ?
and the `` no . ''
it 's not possible . <unk> it 's not much does .
in other of life , a lot <unk> to buy a <unk> of the same explosion of <unk> .
health -- longer the case in the united states removes the doctor , and the doctor says you do is .
instead of the doctor and the doctor says , and we could to do n't have b .
a lot of the benefits of risks .
b has these benefits of risks . what you do ?
and they say , `` doctor , what should i do ? ''
the doctor says , a lot of the benefits of risks and b has those benefits of risks .
what you do ?
and if you say , `` if you have a doctor , what would you do ? ''
the doctor says , `` but i 'm not . ''
that 's -- we call it `` the autonomy . '' sounds like a good thing , but in the reality is a <unk> the burden of responsibility for making individual choices someone who you know -- <unk> the doctor -- i do n't know , <unk> sick and therefore , in the best <unk> 's a decision making -- <unk> patient .
there <unk> marketing is <unk> drugs for people know , and i 'll tell you think about a sense , because we do n't buy .
they advertise around us , we were n't buy ?
the answer is : you expect from the doctor the next morning <unk> and to change capacity to try to change .
and so <unk> our identity the first election , like this slide show you .
we <unk> his identity , we invent stuff .
and we invent -- so often , how we want .
that means that every day , and up , they decide what you kind of person you might want .
in marriage and family was a time in <unk> what was almost every single day , and so fast <unk> how they could then as children and how they could .
the only true that was `` oh , whenever they 're not the world .
today 's all just have .
i <unk> have intelligent students , and i 'll 20 percent less work as i used to .
and not because they are smart , and not because they are carefully .
it 's because you with other things -- if you ask himself , `` i married to do n't tell you marry ?
i later , we should i 'll have kids , or a career ? ''
there are all <unk> questions .
and they can answer independently as if you all the tasks , i <unk> and no good note of course , to get .
and in fact , do that we are important to <unk> questions .
work -- <unk> , as carl <unk> has to <unk> us to every minute , every day of any place on the planet to work -- until the <unk> hotel .
there 's a corner of course , i 'm going to the <unk> work .
i 'm not just because it actually want .
so what it means , these incredible freedom , we have in terms of choices , again and again , whether we should n't work .
we 're feeding the <unk> play <unk> and our mobile in a hip , and our <unk> a new hip , and our laptop , on our lap .
and if you all <unk> of every minute , our child , <unk> one <unk> <unk> ask , `` i should we call suppose ?
i should on this email that we have a letter writing ? ''
and when the answer to the question `` no '' is it certainly their experience of <unk> your child <unk> very different than it does it .

and the world , we lived through this .
so i want to tell there were going to , but everything was a question choice .
and the world today , we live looks .
and so the very good or bad news ?
and the `` yes .
we all know what it 's not so i 'm about what it 's .
all these <unk> have two effects of negative effects of people .
this effect of <unk> way that he <unk> instead <unk> .
and so many options , you vote , and it 's very hard that are going to decide .
so i example of <unk> one of a study about investing 40 volunteers <unk> .
a <unk> of me had access to <unk> of <unk> parent . <unk> about a million staff by year 2000 different <unk> .
and what they found was 80 percent <unk> the largest employer <unk> took full participation . 2 percent .
they 'll <unk> arrive -- 10 percent fewer people assume that as if you just going to be why ?
because it 50 <unk> are , the stand , it 's hard to decide what you choose to do it on tomorrow <unk> .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , the morning of course never .
you can not just means that people <unk> foods we 're going to <unk> , they 're not enough money , <unk> , it means that 's what choices make hard is great <unk> her employer miss .
through the economic participation give up to 5,000 u.s. dollars per year on the <unk> , the top it their contribution to <unk> .
<unk> center of that you to .
and i think it makes is the world .
they want to the decision really properly , if it for all <unk> 's right ?
they want to make false <unk> <unk> , of ridiculous false <unk> .
so that 's an effect on the other effect , even if we <unk> get rid of that i 'd be more satisfied with the result of the world , and for this talk about the more opportunities to decide .
and it 's several reasons for this .
one is <unk> through the big the <unk> <unk> , if you buy it 's not perfect -- and , which <unk> is perfect , it 's such as they 're a decision to meet , we do it 's what happens is this <unk> <unk> alternative to keep your decision <unk> , and this <unk> looks negative impact on average happiness , and <unk> decision was looking at a good choice .
more opportunities are , it 's why do with <unk> that 's <unk> for the election , they meet .
secondly , what economists <unk> .
the gilbert 's a big point , made by he told our way that in the things . the rest of <unk> to do is it is .
well , very different alternatives to think there , it 's just looking at <unk> , as an alternative to <unk> to make more satisfied with the alternatives 're elected .
here 's an example . for some of the new yorker to apologize for me .
but here 's what you think .
here 's a couple of <unk> .
very expensive <unk> .
beautiful beach . great day . they do everything for itself .
what could better be ? `` damn about the man who wrote an august .
everybody in my <unk> in the way .
i could directly from my house <unk> . ''
and he spend two weeks of thoughts that he 's missing the day long day a great a .
<unk> to try to amount of the of course , what we <unk> a fantastic .
and more opportunities , the might be more <unk> properties of the next decade <unk> into .
here 's another example .
well , this cartoon , some of .
he makes a statement about this is now , and perhaps also quite slow it .
but important point , and he is , and it 's important thing to decide what other things that .
and these other things like many <unk> properties , and what will be less <unk> .
: <unk> cultural expectations .
this has anyone in my jeans for them .
i 'm jeans is almost all the time .
and she was a time , it just jeans , there , and they have you bought one , and they 're <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and if you very long enough by and often enough <unk> we 've started laughing , '' <unk> .
so , and jeans to buy years later <unk> , and i said , `` i like , and jeans , here 's my size . ''

you buttons in <unk> ? , like acid <unk> ?
you jeans and holes ?
you by far <unk> , <unk> , blah ... '' and told me .
my jaw , it down and after i started rebounding , `` i would like to be used to the only way . ''
he had no idea what i 've spent an hour with all these <unk> jeans <unk> , and <unk> business -- and i say the truth -- with the best <unk> jeans , ever had .
i 'd better than all the <unk> it gets better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book , to try to itself .
and the fact , i feel bad felt was , with all these <unk> opportunities , ladies and expectations for a good and jeans , i went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete , the only in a way .
as they look at all the damn , one of you have perfect have .
and what i got a good , but it was not perfect .
and compared to what i have had to what i expected , and what i was <unk> in comparison , what i expected .
by adding more opportunities in the people increases <unk> the expectations of people have about how good food opportunities are .
and this leads to see happiness , and think the results that are .
nobody in the <unk> know this is because when they knew you all the point here about .
and the more like this .
the reason is being used to do it was all bad thing than worse , it was for the people , and it 's a surprise .
today in the world , we live in the wealthy as the industrialized citizens , with <unk> an expectation the best for you 're hoping that 's very good at how many of you expect .
they will never it 's because your expectations , ladies and expectations of <unk> are .
the secret to <unk> -- that 's what they all come up -- that secret to <unk> are low expectations .
i want to a short <unk> moment -- that i do with a woman married , they 're really is very beautiful .
i could n't make better be able to do n't <unk> .
but <unk> 's not always a bad thing .
ultimately , as the <unk> a bad <unk> jeans is just a kind to buy it 's like , if you <unk> that you why is responsible for the answer is what 's the world is responsible . what would you can do ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans available now , and they buy a lot <unk> is they 're wondering why , who is responsible ?
it 's also clear that the answer is the right .
you better can do .
and 100 different types of jeans . <unk> , not sorry for mistake .
and so they 're making decisions , and when the results make decisions that we feel very disappointed about what they <unk> itself .
clinical depression <unk> in the industrial world in the generation .
i think of <unk> not the only way , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also <unk> of people who we have the <unk> , because the standards so high , and then they 're looking at these experiences that we need to think it would their fault .
and so that <unk> that it 's generally better . <unk> , and we 're worse .
so let me you remember .
this is <unk> <unk> , that we all the right . completely wrong . it 's not true .
are no question is something the better than anything , but it follows the amount of the better than something the .
it 's a magical things . i 'm not what it is .
and i 'm pretty sure we need to the missing out of the universe <unk> improves .
now as a <unk> question -- i 'm almost finished -- as a <unk> question is talking about what it 's what all the because in the industrialized societies that material about .
are many places in the world , and we have , a lot of their problem , too the world .
the problem is a little bit .
so the things -- who are a <unk> the problem of the rich source of societies .
and what is less frustrating and <unk> is : steve <unk> way to speak yesterday about it tells how much more and hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a <unk> of money .
what i tell what 's incredibly expensive , <unk> decisions -- it 's not to do n't help .
they do it hurts .
you care for the worse , there .

economists call this is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> going to worry that it 's better world -- not just the poor -- because all over the us <unk> .
finally got to read , this cartoon , and then <unk> person says , `` ah ! you know this fish ?
you know it possible in this <unk> . ''
<unk> fantasy , a <unk> the world -- and that 's the way , i was reading .
more , but the the came to the view , that we do n't know .
because the truth is that if you <unk> <unk> so that everything that you have no freedom . they have <unk> .
if you <unk> <unk> so that everything that to focus on average happiness .
so on the <unk> and to the happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost certainly <unk> to be limited -- possibly also for the fish , definitely .
but that <unk> be a <unk> <unk> is a recipe for <unk> , and i guess what disaster .
so much .
as you 've got some of these already had talked about human genome and what i mean , and over the discovery of groups of genes .
actually start by a new point : we have the biology <unk> and now try to digital code in a new phase , get this new life and forth .
we 've always been great questions , to imagine .
what 's life ? it 's something what i think that many biologists to have to understand and that the different levels .
we have different <unk> trying to end up with components to <unk> .
we have <unk> , about <unk> more than we 're <unk> sequence of <unk> to change the <unk> world , the digital world the computer .
now try to ask whether we live <unk> , or whether we new life make sense from this digital universe ?
this map of a small organism appeared <unk> <unk> the smallest genome of species that sets itself in <unk> , and we tried to do with a lot smaller genome that .
we have to the top of hundred genes underlying <unk> from the 500 , here are .
but if you <unk> you look at a very simple , compared to do n't trust me , that 's simple . but if we 're all of the amount of the other <unk> can it 's very unlikely that this to a living cell to happen .
so we 've determined that the only way forward is that chromosome , and <unk> what allows the kind of components to <unk> and so some of <unk> ask yourself .
and so we started to deal with the question as a chromosome <unk> ?
to the chemistry , really big molecule to create what would never done before ?
and if we ca n't we do that chromosome start ?
a chromosome , it , just a piece <unk> their material .
these steps , and <unk> of life -- exponentially .
to genetic code to write a very slowly and yet <unk> . and our last point would have an exponential curve .
we have 15 years started .
it took five years <unk> with a <unk> review , the first experiments in .
out of <unk> very difficult .
there are tens people around the world a little <unk> of dna as a 30 to 50 letters , but it <unk> process , so the longer , you 'll be on this happen .

was our first , <unk> with the digital information , your genome <unk> , the .
it 's a virus that bacteria and .
we have <unk> i made a <unk> and had a dna molecule about 5,000 letters .
the most exciting phase , and this piece <unk> chemical , and in a bacterium , and you , and started off the genetic code to read and <unk> particles .
the <unk> particles , and the cells that i came back and <unk> e. <unk> .
recently , with the <unk> , and they said , so this model of <unk> .
they 're doing it 's doing .
so we think this is a situation is in the software , your hardware to be in a biological system .
but we still take we wanted to <unk> <unk> chromosome . it has more than <unk> the genetic code that we 're going to build it in <unk> from the size of the virus what we , <unk> <unk> able to understand what the individual , a living cell .
which is the key , with <unk> information in the start to adapt these digital is really <unk> .
and human genome , 1995 sequence that was the <unk> a mistake per 10,000 <unk> .
so we 're <unk> from mistakes . if we <unk> sequence , and it would never true . <unk> .
of the design is it <unk> to create the kind of letters that are born with other <unk> <unk> <unk> have to smaller <unk> to build , <unk> .
we have and elements of <unk> .
you might have heard that we <unk> <unk> .
you think about : we have a <unk> code : a degree c , and t .
<unk> of letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino ; and here 's a single <unk> for each of amino .
so we can be genetic code using our words , to write sentences coming .
what we 've just <unk> .
some people were disappointed the poetry was .
we have the <unk> , and that we have a <unk> <unk> that 's <unk> this repair and again <unk> .
and we 've started <unk> to create a <unk> with <unk> the <unk> to <unk> letters <unk> , <unk> these <unk> . <unk> to make these two <unk> the <unk> .
in every step , <unk> the surplus that we 're <unk> , because we took a very <unk> process , to create what you one minute to see .
we tried , the <unk> go .
so , looks like a <unk> .
if we to these really big <unk> get -- about 100,000 <unk> then , not only e. <unk> it 's <unk> all of modern <unk> , went on the mechanisms that .
we knew from a mechanism by the <unk> <unk> called the biology , the dna to repair of these <unk> <unk> .
an example , and that organism , <unk> <unk> the year , and radiation <unk> .
you see the top , a chromosome , apart .
i have 24 hours later , and everything again , <unk> how it was .
we have thousands organisms that can do .
these organisms are totally <unk> things , you can even in a life .
i 'm absolutely need to live in space exist and they 're looking for <unk> conditions .
in nasa has shown that it a out there .
so here <unk> the molecule that we made out by the processes are we 're actually , we 've just <unk> used with the right design , <unk> we have to <unk> of yeast so , and then automatically .
is not <unk> it 's a <unk> <unk> .
it 's a big molecule that we even with the <unk> can see .
these images about a <unk> of six seconds .
so that <unk> 're just recently finished its own .
that are <unk> letters , <unk> code it 's the molecule , <unk> structure that 's actually created .
it has a <unk> of 300 million .
if we with a <unk> 10 years without <unk> <unk> would it would <unk> pages <unk> to this genetic code <unk> .
now is to start a chromosome out how we call it ?
obviously nowadays , with a virus very simple proposition . it 's much more complicated with bacteria to deal
it 's easier if it in <unk> how it does : you just the <unk> out and there , in and that 's exactly what they all about <unk> have heard .
and <unk> is that chromosome into the cell , but recently we have shown you have a complete <unk> one <unk> of a cell in other <unk> can go and we can .
we <unk> that chromosome one <unk> 's roughly , are these two to each of how to other mice . we gave some <unk> , and the chromosome select . we <unk> it with <unk> of the proteins destroying each and it was very amazing , in a cell , and -- and they 're very <unk> <unk> low estimate .
new chromosome in the cell .
actually thought that the end of , but we tried the process of something that .
so that <unk> evolution .
we find all sorts of species here , chromosome from facebook or third of <unk> , and thousands <unk> in just a second to a species <unk> .
and so the evolution , as a gene , and they changed by a lot of biology missing .
there 's <unk> the <unk> be called the kind of dna <unk> .
that chromosome out in the cell was that none of the <unk> we <unk> already .
it was in the cell <unk> and realized the chromosome out <unk> material <unk> , and so we got up with just a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> the blue , which we <unk> .
and after a very short time it all <unk> the species , and <unk> completely in a new species based on the new software , in the cell in this .
and proteins <unk> now , <unk> <unk> going to the genetic code were there was it 's what we <unk> .
it may the genomic <unk> sound , but we 're looking at <unk> <unk> things quite dramatically .
now , so i <unk> this is not the <unk> is -- that 's <unk> billion years ,
and i do <unk> that we possibly 're a new form of <unk> explosion . it 's massive . <unk> based on this digital world that .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty obvious terms of what we need .
we are actually holding six or nine billion people in the next 40 years <unk> .
it ? in my connection to imagine : i was the year <unk> born .
today are three people planet , for every single year <unk> that has got to 40 years appears four .
we have problems with <unk> , with <unk> and <unk> water , the fuel for <unk> billion people .
it is a challenge for nine <unk> .
we need about five billion tons coal <unk> billion <unk> oil . these hundred million <unk> the day .
if we biological processes , or , process to replace it 's a huge challenge .
then , of course , so the co2 of this material that in the atmosphere goes .
we have now , from our discoveries from the world , a database about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that this is <unk> the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and now , where do it came up .
we here , the boundaries between biological reality , for our idea .
we now , because this rapid <unk> order to do what we <unk> genetics .
we have now , a robot to build upon millions of <unk> the day actually .
if you think about 20 million of genes to be different processes to <unk> . <unk> make or drugs new <unk> you can go with a few small team of <unk> change , more of science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we can go <unk> <unk> of the chemicals , <unk> <unk> so forth .
now that of <unk> <unk> we 're working with you actually , down , most famous computers that <unk>
you know , we do n't necessarily you look , we know exactly how their genetic code that .
we focus on now , <unk> fourth generation .
they have recently corn with ethanol from what 's a bad experiment .
we have <unk> the <unk> and third generation of relatively soon out of much higher <unk> have to <unk> or different types of <unk> .
but how we 're not only way of biology a big impact without <unk> the cost of food or limitation of their <unk> have it 's when co2 as <unk> , and so that we get this way .
and we think that we do with <unk> fourth generation of things , and that in about 18 months .
sunlight and we are a method .
but in our discovery , as we all <unk> methods .
this organism , 1996 , it .
he lives in the <unk> is <unk> miles deep , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it <unk> , methane , under the use of hydrogen , <unk> .
we study whether we <unk> co2 , because they 're just <unk> brought to get <unk> removes co2 in fuel use this process <unk> .
within a short time we think that we could be able to the basic questions of life to solve .
and you have n't really -- <unk> goals in places <unk> the <unk> industry . if you know , could do , where else ? '' <unk> energy .
but we 're now , the same <unk> for the <unk> ,
they have to this year with the <unk> , we are always a year , which we have a little bit , when it right <unk> about .
i think that changed , by <unk> <unk> in <unk> created .
this is how the future , might look at changes like today , <unk> of them with synthetic bacteria <unk> you might <unk> .
we are light of the help improve our goal is it just that 's a long enough to survive , possibly to do you .
in the last ted conference on the introduction the lhc .
and i promised to come to take them to explain how the machine works .
now , so as good for all those who did n't there were the lhc is the science experiment , ever <unk> was only 27 kilometers in diameter .

it 's just <unk> <unk> .
this is the machine underneath themselves ,
we take pictures of <unk> in <unk> on .
this work . he 's <unk> detector , <unk> feet in the <unk> multiply 22 feet in diameter .
here of an <unk> in the structure of the <unk> see .
the bottom of the last year was the machine for the ground .
and this picture was a <unk> taken .
it <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
it 's a picture of the <unk> which the whole , the lhc <unk> would deliberately that the lhc <unk> , rain water particles on the detector <unk> .
in other words , and this picture of the 9/11 , i knew that the machine works is a big <unk> .
i do n't whether this , <unk> that , or this , when someone else , i went into the size of <unk> .
what it is the influence the data , .
about a week later on a problem with the machine , with these <unk> here to do n't -- these <unk> 's .

now , the engineers who will you look and say , `` no do that they did n't know that there 's . ''
you can afford because if you very far <unk> going to the so-called <unk> .
at minus <unk> degrees , and , than the space between stars , it 's surface tension <unk> .
in one of connections between the <unk> <unk> the lhc switches and there 's <unk> .
it <unk> there 's <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was a result .

we <unk> so about 50 percent <unk>
and had to the we 're also .
we <unk> a new <unk> .
they are now , again on their way back .
against the march of the lhc , <unk> .
we will be <unk> , and expect that data in june of july of being able to our journey on the way to see what the blocks universe .
now , of course , a kind <unk> these accidents out of debate the value of science and <unk> like . it 's easy , like that <unk> .
i think that 's hard thing about the fact , and our world beyond the world is the entire value of things like the lhc .
so my <unk> words in english scientists to be <unk> <unk> , i suspect , when he was <unk> experiments , <unk> <unk> to be <unk> was a <unk> , what 's nothing is so dangerous for the human mind soon , that our scientific ideas <unk> are the mysteries in the nature is that our <unk> <unk> that 's no new worlds to <unk> there . ''
you .
not a writer .
and writing my profession , but it 's something more .
it 's my big <unk> love and fascination .
and i expect that has ever change .
however , <unk> something <unk> in my life and my career that we 're going to the car accident , to this is completely to rethink together .
this <unk> event , recently a book written on the <unk> called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- that i decided , all my previous books from , the world <unk> and a big <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
that 's a matter where i come to treat now , but <unk> <unk> .
seriously -- the <unk> <unk> .
and they were concerned with me to , <unk> , they 're economic success . <unk> ?
you may not afraid to do you 've spent my <unk> and again , a book . that <unk> in the world in terms again , ? ''
okay , that makes the courage .
it would however , i get you would n't have to 20 years old , as a teenager time , i told me , to do with the same kind of <unk> was faced by .
the people said , <unk> you ca n't afraid to do that have ?
you 're afraid she said , humiliation of <unk> <unk> ?
you 're afraid to this <unk> your whole <unk> and never happened , and that you go on a <unk> <unk> dreams , going to your mouth filled with the <unk> <unk> failure ? ''
so you know .
the answer -- the short answer is all these questions is , <unk>
yes , i 'm afraid of all these things .
and i had always .
and i have millions of the fear , which nobody <unk> .
and algae , and other <unk> things .
but it comes about writing about what i 've been recently , and ask me , why ?
it <unk> ?
it logically it 's expecting to the fear them into the work to do that he <unk> feel ?
and what 's the creative <unk> go to give us not talking <unk> <unk> make a kind of the other professions are n't do ?
my father for example , a chemist , at the situation in 40 years , chemist , and he was asked whether he was the chemist .
with your <unk> , john , the telling ?
it does n't know , ?
but not fair to be -- the group with chemists are two centuries , reputation of <unk> <unk> people .
and writer , but this kind of that , but not just the writers but in the <unk> n't seem to call to have been mentally <unk> unstable .
because they do need to get it 's <unk> <unk> a really great heads , from the 20th century look at a young and often own hand on .
and even people who did n't actually <unk> <unk> it seemed their talent away <unk> been .
norman <unk> she 's his death in the interview , <unk> my books , a bit further <unk>
this extraordinary statement about what you <unk> can do .
but we <unk> do n't even if someone like that say , because we 're about a long time , i 've <unk> so <unk> and <unk> accepted that creativity and to kind of <unk> and that art -- the bottom -- and the <unk> .
the question is what we can imagine what is , is this idea for you completely right ?
feel ashamed to think ? because with just an inch <unk> look ... i feel with this <unk> n't think .
i think they <unk> .
and i think about dangerous . and i do n't want to see , the next century , .

and i know definitely hard for me -- in the situation -- very dangerous would start this dark path of <unk> of <unk> -- especially to be in . i was in my career i 'm going .
that means that you see : i 'm young . i 'm just about 40 years old .
i do n't yet another 40 <unk> in me .
and it 's extremely , so , and now , i 'm going anywhere near the work <unk> , in the world <unk> in the last book came right ?
i say it <unk> , because we 're now all my friends -- it 's highly probably my <unk> success behind me .
oh , jesus , for a thought !
these kinds of people hate anyone get to 9 . start to <unk> to drink and i want .
i would continue this work with love .
so the question : how ?
after some time , <unk> seems that i 'm going to continue to being a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> design .
i 'm very well , to to write a safe distance between real life turned to my very natural <unk> about how the early on <unk> .
and the last year of evidence for me that , we 've also , for and i tried , some societies that to see if they might better or <unk> ideas about what had to the creative can do with the , to deal of creativity that are .
this , so the old <unk> and that , rome .
you follow me , because the circle going to close .
but in <unk> and rome . we did n't <unk> that creativity of people saying , okay ?
they believed that creativity . <unk> <unk> was to come from a distant from the unknown is to the people coming back from <unk> virtually unknown reasons .
the greeks called of divinity <unk> of creativity <unk> .
and <unk> is known that he was believed , he had a <unk> of the wisdom of them , <unk> .
the <unk> had the same idea called this kind of <unk> <unk> mind , <unk> .
that 's great . '' <unk> were n't really want you a a particularly <unk> <unk> was .
they believed that a kind <unk> <unk> beings when i 'm <unk> that it literally in the walls of <unk> lives -- about how <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and i work <unk> invisible <unk> the result of design .
that 's brilliant , there is it , there 's the distance , i talked about the psychological <unk> , you to follow your work protect .
and everybody knew it worked , right ?
the artists , <unk> ago , certain things to speak for example , much <unk> right ?

if your work <unk> -- not entirely your mistakes ?
everybody knew , from it <unk> .
so far west very long time about creativity that .
and then came across the renaissance and everything changed . we had this idea . and this big idea was : let us human <unk> the center of them -- about the gods and mysteries . it 's no room was <unk> creatures . <unk> of divinity that .
it 's the at the <unk> <unk> and the people started to think creativity is my own <unk> came up .
for the first time , how this sort of artists a call -- instead of he 's a genius .
i tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know what i think of naked to allow that he thinks he or say , <unk> like a and the essence of the source of divinity or creative process , <unk> , <unk> <unk> is a little bit much responsibility , when they 're <unk> the human psyche <unk> .
it 's like to ask for the <unk> .
that <unk> and <unk> whole <unk> and it creates these <unk> expectations of success .
i think that <unk> our artists from 500 years <unk> .
and , if you -- and i think it -- is the question :
so how to change ?
maybe to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative <unk> .
maybe not .
maybe we <unk> from 500 years <unk> <unk> not just in a <unk> talk <unk> .
and it 's certainly people in this audience , which is really <unk> for doubt <unk> think about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> the <unk> and <unk> their projects , using
i 'm probably not all of them on this journey to blame .
but the question . <unk> want is : why ?
why does n't think ?
because it as much sense of everything , and i 've learned when we went from absolutely crazy <unk> <unk> the creative process to explain .
a process is , everybody knows , it ever tried to happen to make -- so , in other , everyone here -- not always <unk> behave .
and then he sometimes <unk> <unk> feel .
i had recently , to encounter the extraordinary a poet <unk> stone in the 90 percent , but you 've had a poet , they told me that they were in <unk> virginia up out on the was said , they would feel and listen to be like a poem by the landscape , <unk> .
they said it would like a <unk> move from air .
the entire country , <unk> .
they felt it comes eventually , because it would be under their feet , <unk> .
they knew that they 're going to just one could it was -- in their words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they ran across the devil got home , of this poem for about it was only about , so fast enough to a sheet became a pen , had to buy it comes through the <unk> , from passengers on the sheet <unk> .
other it was n't fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but they reached the not a poem <unk> through the and you missed it . he said it would like this country , and -- how they said , <unk> a poet <unk> .
and then there are moments -- if you 'll never forget -- they said , <unk> there in fact , missed .
so they <unk> the house and brain of paper and that 's the air travel through and they <unk> a pen , as it through <unk> and then he said , you it was going to the other hand , the it <unk> .
they <unk> poem from his <unk> and moved it back in your body <unk> it on the sheet .
these <unk> a poem <unk> and the world . '' -- but backwards -- the last word time , .
when i thought `` a -- that 's exactly how my creative process <unk>
that 's not like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel .
i 'm a <unk> in order to be able to every day the same time up and <unk> . <unk> and uncomfortable <unk> .
but even photographed in my <unk> , sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess that many of you can also done .
so i had a new ideas from a source of me <unk> i did n't identify .
what is that for a thing ?
and like , and the relationship , about our minds to lose the world . even <unk> health to ?
now for the living in how to create an individual musician tom <unk> . i <unk> a few years ago for a magazine <unk> .
we 've got this topic . and you know what ? the most of was tom the embodiment of <unk> modern <unk> i tried to <unk> creative <unk> to him <unk> to control and with you <unk> .
but then he was older and <unk> . he told me he 's one day on a <unk> in angeles , and it 's changed , everything for him .
he went with high speed as he 's a little <unk> a tune , which is associated <unk> often the things for him <unk> this tangible , and he stopped . <unk> . <unk> , but he can not in .
he has a piece of he has no pen , he has no <unk> .
he so , these old <unk> in the <unk> the way , `` i was lose pulling out of this song on , that .
i 'm not good enough , i <unk> it <unk>
but instead of panic , to get treated stopped at the world .
he ended the <unk> and did something completely new .
he <unk> just in the sky , <unk> you can you ca n't have in the ? ''
<unk> i look as i just a song <unk> ?
if you really exist want to come to a <unk> moment , when i want to show you care .
if <unk> , somebody else .
go and <unk> leonard <unk>
and <unk> <unk> , and changed .
ca n't work itself . it was as often the dark side <unk> the .
but the process and the <unk> <unk> to him <unk> was <unk> when he 's genius from it took place where nothing more trouble <unk> in their <unk> where this . he realized that , it <unk> , <unk> to be .
it was a <unk> truly miraculous , bizarre , from a conversation and tom to <unk> , <unk> thing that . tom was .
when you 've been changed as a little bit , i worked and it has already has saved .
this idea <unk> me , in <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> was . i fell in this <unk> the <unk> , we fall into something to believe it works . <unk> able to think that it 's <unk> going to the worst , ever written .
not just bad for the worst most
i started to think i should we just <unk> .
but also reminded me , like tom , and the sky said , and i tried it .
i want to look at <unk> and spoke to comment in an empty the vastness of .
i was clear : <unk> sort of thing , and i know , you like this book , brilliant , it does n't completely my fault , the right ?
because you see , yeah , because i 've got to <unk> to do something more .
if you why is better . we want to here <unk> and what percentage of <unk> <unk> .
but if you ca n't that . ... you know what we are devils .
i 'm still kept writing because that 's my job .
and i urge to <unk> have to that part of jobs here <unk>
because ... ... '' it 's like a few centuries , in the deserts <unk> lot of <unk> the sacred <unk> and music <unk> the <unk> <unk> were trying to <unk> .
this -- were still a great because the dancer and professional and they were fantastic .
but and again , very rarely has happened something special zones of the <unk> was actually <unk> .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know you all in their lives in places like <unk> have seen .

and suddenly the `` no longer in human .
he was the <unk> and , <unk> and everything <unk> spreads through a <unk> fire .
i do n't know , we say , what that was . they called all his name .
they put their hands together and began to sing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> `` oh my god , <unk>
that 's god , you know ?
a historic <unk> : the <unk> <unk> <unk> and they need to the <unk> changed slowly , centuries of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a lot of <unk> and <unk> sounds .
if a <unk> in spain , <unk> , something <unk> did n't <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a great <unk> <unk> , there is it : a <unk> of god .
and that 's great , because we need that .

he 's just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> . and maybe it again , to these and <unk> .
and perhaps will never again , the names , when he turns . but what he then with the rest of start ?
that 's hard .
that 's <unk> <unk> one of life .
but does not a <unk> for the beginning of course , <unk> have a <unk> aspects of <unk> of them <unk> .
if you might just think that <unk> in the <unk> source for a <unk> time of the somebody <unk> will be done with .
if we start to think about changes all .
so i started to think and so i think you years after of the book working together to appear to measure than the dangerous , <unk> there are expected <unk> the <unk> <unk> .

<unk> .
last year , these slides shown you see if you can <unk> <unk> to <unk> three million years of the size of the bottom 48 states had to 40 percent <unk> .
but this <unk> very strong enough to <unk> this particular problem , which there 's not the thick of <unk> .
the sense of this <unk> <unk> that <unk> heart of global <unk> .
it grows in winter winds <unk> was .
the next slide i 'm sure that 's a <unk> what has been 25 years happened .
that <unk> is the red that .
can see if it on the <unk> <unk> this is an annual the winter , and it <unk> was .
now , <unk> five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is something here <unk> .
in 25 years ago , `` it 's gone .
this is a problem , because the global warming , <unk> reason the arctic ocean <unk> in . it big amounts <unk> carbon , which is <unk> of microbes have methane of .



wow !
you 're doing good . so the front of us <unk> .
and a reason is this enormous <unk> of greenland from the north america .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume 30 , <unk> than ever before .

other of the west antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
last month <unk> researchers led by the entire continent now a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> , a few years , <unk> <unk> the problem is particularly in the <unk> .
so we are foot <unk> the greenland .
in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> the top of the past few years glacier .
40 percent of people to get half of <unk> from this <unk> .
in the <unk> is this glacier , <unk> for this town .
the <unk> have <unk> .
but if you <unk> , the end of water <unk> .
in california was a 40 <unk> <unk> the <unk> in sierra .
it 's the <unk> .
and predict how they 're reading more deeply seriously .
this <unk> , leads to a <unk> <unk> on fire .
and the disaster in the in a really <unk> and before . <unk> <unk> up .
, many last 30 years ago in the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if this , the historical , you can see what it <unk> .
in the last five years we have 70 million tons of co2 produced , 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the oceans .
take off the area 25 , pacific , and from the continent <unk> and <unk> the indian <unk> , where does it <unk> decline of <unk> in the <unk> .
the biggest single factor for the global warming , the next to about 20 percent is this burning of fossil fuels .
this is a problem , and coal , nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states are two <unk> <unk> with china .
and the suggestion was a <unk> to build .
but we start with a change .
here are the rest of the last 10 <unk> , with some green alternatives for the election .
<unk> a political <unk> in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> spent a clean coal supply <unk> , what we 've been a contradiction in this is .
this reminded me something .
the christmas -- ran across the home in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> .
they have it <unk> in the news .
this is in our country , <unk> <unk> america .
this happened before christmas .
one <unk> the <unk> before christmas was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
it is <unk> and the in america , and helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> going to clean .
he 's <unk> and <unk> the ability to stay in <unk> fresh bread .
this is the source of coal in west virginia .
the most <unk> is the amount of <unk> <unk> .
let me a very clear to say al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they do n't what they talk .
so the <unk> for <unk> two <unk> a <unk> .
now this is part of her .
and <unk> look at <unk> as a serious risk for our business .
so we have to the top <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> on the way of the truth about coal .
the fact coal is not <unk> .

so , they do n't have <unk> .
leave you could quiet .
<unk> coal may have heard of
so , let 's a tour of modern , <unk> <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it 's going to the <unk> <unk> .
and yet , burning of coal of the reasons for the global warming is a remarkable clean <unk> these are changes everything .
look , it 's look at this is 's a clean <unk> .
finally <unk> more positive , our economic challenge to the national security .
america 's in a global economy , the national security services <unk> .
the red thread of these all connects us is our dependence <unk> <unk> how <unk> coal mining <unk> oil .
but now there <unk> new solution to take us from that <unk> able to <unk> .
<unk> america starts 100 percent clean the new neurons within the next 10 years
a plan to back to work of us safer to help the global warming , to stop .
finally , a solution to make enough to our problems to solve .
<unk> america . they worked out .
this is the last .
it 's a <unk> of america .
one the ways of our dependence of the <unk> <unk> of our world <unk> to reduce .
the future is the wind , and a new this .
by investing in the good <unk> jobs .
<unk> america . it 's the same reality accept .
there 's old african , `` if you , and i want to go alone .
if you go far they want to go together . ''
so far from a fast .
you .
i want to begin to ask the time your childhood <unk> , when you with <unk> played .
they realized the hands <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> , i learned you 're going to think about issues , to change <unk> <unk> to solve .
that <unk> think is closely with all the amount of our environment .
as <unk> -- inspired by the kind of interaction with the objects -- with my <unk> <unk> my colleagues <unk> <unk> , i started me to <unk> , what would have computers use those services instead of <unk> to like a digital <unk> on a <unk> <unk> so ... ... what would you start with two hands <unk> , and the physical <unk> and so <unk> could , and it ?
this question was so <unk> we 're going to exploration of the answer , and <unk> developed .
in a <unk> is a <unk> the size <unk> .
you can actually holding the things , you can they perceive that you can their movements , and they have a screen , <unk> .
importantly , who are physically , because you know how <unk> merely by <unk> the hands and <unk> move .
and the <unk> to give a new generation of <unk> the manipulation <unk> data .
and if these tools <unk> a little bit about their movements that they recognize patterns <unk> our <unk> to perceive bats then we can only exploration , and <unk> <unk> begin .
and with some simple examples .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and when i was a direction <unk> going to move a ; if it in the other direction <unk> it 's it backwards .
and this interactive portraits , they true .

if you <unk> surrounded and notice that you , and can be nervous .
and you feel as their movements , and .
this as social interactions , it started to our everyday gestures on the use this is to see colors . <unk> how this with <unk> does .
, in the last three <unk> as <unk> <unk> and i can use artificial color , in the middle of <unk> where they 're <unk> .
if we <unk> as a little <unk> .
there 's also some <unk> opportunities in education , languages , or <unk> where the people , the rapid <unk> , and the results , you want .
, it 's a <unk> paper with a simple <unk> <unk> .
that 's a game with words , is a kind of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , the each round of <unk> birthday <unk> letters and while you 've words that would be about <unk> through .
then i think about 30 seconds , again <unk> and you a new <unk> and new opportunities to
you .
are some children on a <unk> at mit , and i could to move to try and a video has taken .
they have it really loved .
interesting be this kind of applications is that the people of instructions to adapt .
everything , you need is `` is words , and you know exactly what to do is .
here are still a few people to test .
this <unk> <unk> the bottom right .
and they found , he <unk> you stack them .
so for him were just <unk> .
now this interactive <unk> .
we wanted to <unk> for <unk> .
that 's <unk> .
he new characters in the scene , by the <unk> the table <unk> the character .
here in the sun <unk> .
and it .
now <unk> a <unk> in the scene .
the <unk> <unk> .
good work ! yeah !
by the <unk> shake and they <unk> put the vast characters interact with ...
... own story .
hello !
it 's a story with <unk> , and he can decide how do you .
flying cat .
the last example , i 've got to show you is a <unk> for <unk> that we recently 've got to <unk> as sound like to <unk> , <unk> and <unk> the .
she has four different variations which you can choose which you use it .
and you might sound of sequence <unk> , again in , patterns <unk> .
and you <unk> it is just <unk> a <unk> on .
there are effects of live with this is to the hall of filters .
you , it with this sound and <unk> and then we hire .

so let me .
we start to do we <unk> in two <unk> <unk> and this in a series <unk> a spiritual and a bit more than you add up .
now add a <unk> add up .
now i 'm still <unk> to do .
and i 'll notice this with the <unk> 're going to the effect live taxes .

and i 'll the filters , with the <unk> ; something that expression .

and i have to shut down <unk> plan , and improvising ; meanwhile <unk> or <unk> .
and finally , all the sequence <unk> by the <unk> left <unk> .
you .
how you can see , is my desire to new <unk> going to be able to fit into our brains and bodies .
and today i had the same kind of this new <unk> and some ways of the what we in our lab .
the idea , and i 'm going to what i 'm going to the threshold of this new generation of <unk> the interaction with digital media in the information in our world into the right under the .
you ,
i 'm glad to the conversation with them all .
