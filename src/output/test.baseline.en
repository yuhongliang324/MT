when steve lopez , <unk> the angeles times per day through the streets of course , i stopped a music .
they came from a man , an <unk> , <unk> , <unk> no longer homeless person on a <unk> played not just two strings .

nathaniel left <unk> had suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , he was <unk> streets of <unk> <unk> center of angeles .
i <unk> all the <unk> book , to say it , `` look , not just the wonderful <unk> trying to cross between these two men that 's just like to the music , and actually helped and finally the instrument was , if this <unk> allowed to <unk> , nathaniel and the street differently .
i met mr <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in <unk> disney <unk> hall .
he had just <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and came behind the stage to me as .
he talked in a very <unk> and <unk> sound of <unk> ma , hillary clinton about how the <unk> it in baseball world <unk> create . and it <unk> passage in <unk> last sentence of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we came to the music to talk about a few days later i got email to live in fact that nathaniel . <unk> me interested .
i know that nathaniel a medical treatment <unk> , because he was already with <unk> and with <unk> and <unk> treated by a trauma to him an entire life that .
as one day , especially vulnerable , <unk> <unk> there are sometimes so bad , and <unk> <unk> in the streets of <unk> <unk> <unk> of this <unk> , and <unk> his own mind exactly .
and in exactly where <unk> was nathaniel , and interacting with <unk> in the <unk> disney <unk> hall , and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and <unk> completely lost .
he talked about , <unk> and smoke the way , in <unk> <unk> .
i was scared , not <unk> , but i was afraid that i want to make it into the states <unk> could interact with him a relationship to <unk> destroy , and i started talking <unk> and <unk> and exciting forms of <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started to be able to play .
i played the first sentence of <unk> <unk> .
and while i 'm going to go , in <unk> eyes , <unk> change on in .
it was as if he the impact of invisible <unk> was a chemical response was <unk> my game was .
<unk> <unk> <unk> into an understanding of a quiet , and <unk> .
and through a miracle , he <unk> and started to your ear some clips from <unk> to play and asked me back to end to play : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .

and i was not just a <unk> about music had , but it with you 've also a <unk> personal relationship <unk> .
he talked to stay with a passion and understanding , because only one of my colleagues in the <unk> of angeles know .
with music playing the music , i was from this <unk> , <unk> man just been through the streets of angeles <unk> was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> work , <unk> <unk> musician .
it 's medicine . he likes to us .
for nathaniel means that <unk> health .
because the music allows him and feelings and delusions of his imagination and creativity session a real <unk> .
and so <unk> he was <unk> <unk> .
i understood that 's a human beings with an art is .
in this is why ca n't do this is in all the deep inside of our feelings of artistic lens through our creativity to the forms .
and the fact that <unk> of us , and moves , and <unk> us .
what nathaniel <unk> to him the music back a community of friends .
the <unk> power music brought him back a family of musicians from your mind , the future talent realized that <unk> .
and i 'll go with nathaniel music , in the <unk> disney <unk> hall , <unk> <unk> , because he reminds me , why i musician , i am .
you .
bruno giussani : much .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play . <unk> the <unk> stolen .
i hope you <unk> me .
so i have in my life many fish <unk> .
i 've only loved .
the first , that was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a fish , <unk> good <unk> , <unk> , a best-selling , <unk> .
what a fish .
even better , he was <unk> that . the standards of sustainability <unk> .
you could you probably helps you want to sell .
i had with this beauty , about several months .
one day called the head company , i wondered whether of an you could only sustainability by the farm .
`` course , '' i said .
here was a company to solve tried to do this <unk> problem for chefs in fact , retain more fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years on , <unk> the forests <unk> <unk> .
it 's hard , the destruction of <unk> .
90 percent of fish , the amount of the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so now , or <unk> <unk> , <unk> of our future .
these arguments against . <unk> <unk> the environment , the most of them anyway , and they are inefficient ones that <unk> . a big disadvantage .
he <unk> years ago , one .
that means 15 pounds <unk> are needed to be pounds <unk> get .
not very sustainable .
tastes , very good .
so here was finally a company , it properly .
i wanted to be supported .
the day of an called the head of <unk> for the company .
're <unk> .
`` <unk> , '' i said , `` just to the facts , and you are famous for so far out in <unk> that it 's not <unk> . ''
`` that , '' he said , `` we are so far out the waste our a distributed to do . ''

this <unk> of <unk> voice 1 , '' he said .
`` the best way of . ''
<unk> to one great .
`` <unk> , and what ? what <unk> her ? ''
and sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said to put on .
and this evening was my bed and thought , what the hell is a sustainable be ?
so called the next day , just as an enormous <unk> .
i <unk> , for sustainable this ? ''
he said , he <unk> how he 'll <unk> .
well , i <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could me a <unk> answer , until finally , <unk> biologists <unk> .
're also <unk> .
`` <unk> , '' i said , `` what for sustainable this ? ''
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , <unk> the skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to forage <unk> . ''
i said , `` how much about <unk> <unk> 's chicken ? ''
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
`` well , about 30 percent , '' he said .

there was a break in the line , are just a chicken in the world . ''
i <unk> sort of this fish .
no , and i <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that even .
no , i 've <unk> lot of this fish <unk> , because i swear , god , the fish the entertainment and chicken <unk> .
the second fish that 's a kind of <unk> .
it 's the romantic in the way that , you 've ever done in his fish know , the fish on love .
i gave him first in a restaurant in <unk> a .
a <unk> a had been <unk> of this fish ,
it has <unk> <unk> .
he came on the table with a <unk> almost <unk> have color .
the chef came to <unk> .
wait twice .
amazingly he was still a delicious .
who 's a fish and taste , after he <unk> was ?
i can get rid of this guy , it .
're miguel , which is miguel .
and no , he has to do n't <unk> and he 's a chef at least in the way to try and understand .
he 's a biologist , <unk> la <unk> .
now that <unk> in the <unk> corner <unk> .
it 's close to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .

they <unk> <unk> , which is basically <unk> .
they 're looking at the country <unk> .
and this complicated of <unk> , and they urged water from the country , and beyond the river .
well , they could n't make that the <unk> and economically .
and <unk> it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of birds , which is for this place many birds are .
and so since 1982 , <unk> company with green , bought .
what ?
they have the river , <unk> , .
they have literally , <unk> <unk> .
instead , <unk> used to <unk> the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the <unk> .
they created a <unk> of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> those shrimp , the eel that we 've miguel and his company , <unk> destruction of , .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they 're never seen .
they <unk> out on the <unk> there was a million miles away , and what you are <unk> <unk> go and density levels <unk> march .
i was there was n't really long time ? miguel .
he 's incredible guy , and charles darwin and of it 's a <unk> , <unk> . ''
okay ? there were able to <unk> us through the <unk> and i <unk> and <unk> the <unk> up to my <unk> which is miguel the last quiet revolution <unk> .
here the a rare <unk> out .
i mentioned , he <unk> of <unk> .
and here to see here 's a pattern of <unk> , that at the <unk> <unk> reminds us .
it turns out ? miguel , of his career in <unk> in africa time .
i asked him , how he 's a <unk> of .
he said , `` do n't know about it .
here to expert of relationships . ''
and then when he and <unk> something more <unk> a rare birds and algae and , <unk> .
and get me wrong , that was really fascinating know , <unk> community <unk> , in the way .
it 's great , but i love .
and my head was weak that <unk> piece <unk> <unk> , that i <unk> .
and so i asked by . i miguel , how it 's your fish and tastes ? ''
he showed on the algae .
`` oh boy , the algae , the <unk> of those relationships , that 's unbelievable .
but what eat your fish ?
it 's the <unk> ? ''
well , he continue to me tell you a <unk> system is that the fish , you 're in the <unk> food .
the <unk> biomass of the <unk> , and <unk> , this is what the fish <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
is no food .
one of a farm in their dignity . <unk> ?
and the day , and knocked on this site is miguel around and i asked him , i was a place , the size of course , to be different than the farm more than ever been was , `` how 's not succeed ? ''
moment , as a <unk> a <unk> , .

`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look , their <unk> the pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was confused .
i miguel , <unk> on your fish ? ''
`` yes , he said .
`` we 20 percent of the fish and <unk> the birds .
well , last year , on this site <unk> birds became more than 250 different .
it is today , and one of the private <unk> in europe .
i miguel , which is a good <unk> <unk> the last , on a <unk> we want ? ''
he <unk> his head .
he said , `` we build <unk> do n't <unk> .
is a <unk> network .
the flamingos , the <unk> .
the <unk> eat the <unk> .
the <unk> so the <unk> and the system . ''
okay , let 's completely rethink in a farm where dignity . <unk> and a farm in their success of health of <unk> 's .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and , and these flamingos on <unk> n't even there .
they <unk> in a city <unk> miles away the <unk> better for the <unk> .
every morning they <unk> at the farm .
and every night they <unk> miles back .
they do that they 're going <unk> white line of <unk> <unk> follow .
seriously .
i had a kind of the penguins , i looked at miguel .
i miguel they <unk> miles of the farm and they 're <unk> miles back at night ?
you do that the children ? ''
he looked at i just a song , <unk> the <unk> .
he said , `` no . they do n't want to eat better . ''
i 'm not the skin , <unk> <unk> mentioned the most delicious , and i like , <unk> like , <unk> like , <unk> .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i <unk> almost never .
and then you in this restaurant in <unk> try and it does n't <unk> <unk> .
they <unk> sweet and it as if you <unk> the ocean that .
i mentioned that we miguel , <unk> .
he said , `` the skin looks like a swam .
it 's the last <unk> before , in the body <unk> .
they 've improved over the developed a <unk> <unk> . ''

okay . a farm in your fish , <unk> . a farm in their success 's the success of <unk> .

it 's a river , all the things that leads to get out rivers , they tend to say , and chemical pollutants in <unk> of <unk> .
and if it spreads through the system <unk> , and this leaves , and clean , when it <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it <unk> water .
so not just a farm where dignity . <unk> , not just a farm in their success of health of <unk> 's a farm , literally a <unk> is not just for these fish , for you tie me .
because if it <unk> , <unk> it in <unk> .
a drop in the , i know , but i want to do n't do , because these <unk> , how <unk> , is also <unk> .
you might say , this recipe for future of good food if we 're <unk> or <unk> .
what we need it 's a radically new concept of agriculture of a much food in your taste .
but for many people 's a bit more radical .
we are not <unk> , we <unk> , lover .
we love <unk> . we love babies <unk> . we <unk> food . we <unk> .
and when they claim that the other things are the future of good food tell -- somebody somewhere , `` hey , and i love <unk> flamingos , but you 're going to feed ?
how to the world feed ? ''
i be ?
i like this question .
no , not because we have enough calories of the world more than just to feed .
a billion people today <unk> .
a billion -- that 's more than ever before -- because <unk> <unk> in the distribution tend not the <unk> .
well , i like this question is why they 're using logic of <unk> the last 50 years , that .
<unk> grain of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> mixing chemicals in the earth 's chicken wing , and that has the <unk> just asked , `` if we more people , feed , how awful lot of be ? ''
and that <unk> . it was the <unk> . it was the <unk> american agriculture .
we should they 're going to <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> very quickly <unk> in the kind of the production is .
that 's not <unk> , and it is n't agriculture .
our <unk> is today under , not because <unk> <unk> , because <unk> resources .
it through the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> country , by pumps , fresh water through <unk> , forests , and by <unk> bed nets , fish in .
they want to feed ?
, let 's start with the question : how we going , we feed ?
or better , so for the root to enable us to feed ?
that , we look at the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's , .
, chemistry and i stand inside <unk> and it has never happened really good for food produced .
so instead of <unk> model .
this is , on two billion years <unk> <unk> .
if you miguel , farmers : miguel .
<unk> one of themselves are <unk> the <unk> instead <unk> , <unk> the <unk> grow instead of <unk> the farmers are not just <unk> are not experts are relationships .
because they are the other things that taste .
and when i really , and you , chef school , ever going to you .
you know that 's all right , because if that 's good food is , it delicious .
thanks .
if i thing <unk> want to the <unk> data , we consume the bigger than the sum of <unk> and instead of the <unk> to think i want to give you think about how we use them to the pattern to and we are trends , because otherwise , visible to be .
so what we see here 's a typical <unk> looking at <unk> .
and i 'll use it 's a little experiment .

and immediately i see a different patterns , that it makes us .
and they 're in <unk> here at the <unk> are all over here , <unk> are .
we can step out and <unk> the data set up and you can <unk> and cancer , the <unk> who are not for every day .
if we now <unk> and the age <unk> say 40 years , younger you might be accidents and <unk> is about the other people worry about .
and <unk> looks like , this is particularly the men <unk> .
you so what we look at the data in this way to start swimming in a <unk> <unk> reminds us .
and if we , <unk> , why not for content that ?
what shall have here are the <unk> every single day <unk> <unk> i 've ever <unk> .
it 's all right here . it 's all online .
you can see , and talk to <unk> test .
and <unk> you can <unk> in a decade .
you can <unk> in particular year .
you can not directly to a certain <unk> jump .
if i now here so i was <unk> , in this <unk> appear and the <unk> .
i 'm a <unk> armstrong fan , so <unk> i <unk> <unk> , all to show in <unk> armstrong mentioned .
now , when i just a <unk> <unk> get what i could i think , what if i do with the subject <unk> <unk> ? ''
so i take a and <unk> of view .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so , the idea that if you on this kind of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the brain , or <unk> not just being .
you will actually bit different .
it 's something between what we think it changes the way to be used .
so this idea now , and do with about what a little nuts .
what we did n't have the things we have every single <unk> took a little bit <unk> reduced .
the <unk> contains a short <unk> and a symbol for the area from the heat coming .
i 'm just following the top , the <unk> <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view of a lot of doing .
i want to give the most of wikipedia , <unk> are .
so i , <unk> to vote .
well , after i <unk> 're elected -- i know , that the <unk> it 's going to time <unk> `` people year survival .
this is really important , there , this insight is not in a single <unk> this .
that 's just to recognize when you take <unk> and all that you .
<unk> on a certain point <unk> and then there 's time <unk> `` people the line straight lines , and all together .

and interestingly , bono , and the winner .
so we can not jump into a look at ted the winner throw it .
you 're surfing the first time as if it really a net , is not just the other side , but more abstract .
and so i thought what else , what a little surprise . .
so here , just a new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i do n't make a browser call it 's really the browser , but you can websites to look -- and we are <unk> to every single is like this .
i can see them step back to directly to a specific <unk> jump .
that 's so it 's no , you look at websites in this way of all <unk> the same way we can .
i can see them in my the zoom in a certain <unk> .
right here on the demonstration , until <unk> this .
and i can , because i 've her , again <unk> .
and i 'll take <unk> and on all look like to the new <unk> maybe in my <unk> . here , i 've been looking <unk> visual for , here , bing -- here to live <unk> <unk> .
and here , in the side <unk> and again and .
it 's a metaphor , again , and she makes it 's <unk> than the sum of <unk> .
now , in this world , we think that 's a curse .
we talk a curse at the <unk> .
we talk , `` <unk> in information . ''
what if this situation <unk> , which is that imagine , instead of these are going to start of things like to go to the pattern of what otherwise , the united ?
if you can do , these <unk> <unk> , maybe a new source <unk> information .
and instead of being in the world , we know it .
and if we know the then , maybe wisdom , it .
so i hear , you .
i grew up <unk> <unk> science fiction .
in my school , and i do with the bus to school , every hour , , .
and my nose was always in a book , an <unk> , that my thoughts in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> way , deep in me <unk> , <unk> curiosity <unk> .
and curiosity and also have been that i always going to school was , through the forests <unk> , <unk> and `` we 've collected those frogs and snakes are beetles , <unk> all home , and the microscope looked .
i was totally <unk> you know .
it was that , and the world , and the borders outside , all <unk> .
and my love to science fiction , and in my environment <unk> , because at least in the late '60s who flew the moon and <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in our living with his <unk> shows us to animals and places like a world of wonder showed up , we 've been never had .
and then , very good that <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there are n't video yet these <unk> with <unk> movies , all the <unk> in the media and i had , in my head . .
that we had at all . if we 've got a book were just took the description of <unk> and <unk> the screen in our heads .
my response to to draw and draw forth <unk> , <unk> worlds of robots , <unk> and all the .
in <unk> i was constantly doing it 's the way , i <unk> <unk> hidden in <unk> .
and creativity to wait , out .
and i was something interesting . what excites us to put <unk> <unk> shows fascinated me the idea , we completely unknown , here on the earth itself .
certainly would submit it 's never aliens come with a spaceship . it seemed that 's unlikely .
but here was a world , i actually into a little earth , and she was fascinating and <unk> like that all , what i was always presented with my books read .
so i decided to 15 years <unk> .
in the problem that , in a small village in canada , it . miles from the ocean .
i made me , <unk> .
i <unk> my father , he finally , <unk> in <unk> the city , nor detect all around the other side , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in winter , <unk> a new york .
the ocean surface of the ocean , i got only two years later , to face , and then i moved .
since the next 40 years , which may <unk> we 've been about three years for underwater time in the day depending on <unk> .
and i 've learned that the world <unk> , even in the <unk> <unk> , this rich , <unk> life is to really hardly .
and fantasy nature knows is , to of the <unk> human imagination .
until today , <unk> the deepest <unk> what happens when i 'm <unk> see .
and my love the ocean on the exact same intensity as <unk> the .
i said , adult a profession <unk> it was that <unk> .
it seemed the best way through inner <unk> the stories agree with my need to get to be able to .
as <unk> i always <unk> and so .
so these films , the images , <unk> . <unk> together .
of the stories . <unk> like <unk> the terminator , '' `` aliens , `` <unk> . ''
letters <unk> '' i mean <unk> for the <unk> and that , with the <unk> .
so <unk> kind of my two passions .
something interesting happened about <unk> '' : the <unk> problem in this film to solve -- and that we had such a kind <unk> <unk> create -- and <unk> , we <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
what 's the universe was the first <unk> <unk> 've ever in a film that was .
the film -- does n't figure out , and he just his <unk> , but i realized something amazing ted audience , was like <unk> from <unk> kind of <unk> .
and arthur clarke 's law , <unk> <unk> technology <unk> to each other .
you saw something <unk> .
and that i found <unk> exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , that is the <unk> <unk> . ''
so we went in the terminator , `` my next movie , on .
together with <unk> created this is the ocean <unk> metal ones toward success <unk> , depending on how this effect get yourself .
and it worked . and we had something <unk> . and the effect in the same . however , with the movie , a bit more money <unk> .
of these two experiences from was a new world , a new world of creativity . <unk> .
i founded a company with my good friend <unk> <unk> , the time way to <unk> and <unk> was . she was a digitally <unk> . ''
the idea that company in the second phase <unk> processes with <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the same with digital <unk> '' .
that we then , and <unk> us , <unk> a <unk> .
but in the '90s , <unk> , but we 're in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , i was founded had been slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` avatar is written in the <unk> a visual effects of <unk> effects in new and <unk> should , with <unk> human beings <unk> characters are using <unk> , had . and the <unk> should all <unk> in the world , <unk> .
but the <unk> <unk> , back and the people in my company me that we <unk> been able to be able to make .
so <unk> , and speeches into film about big ship , that <unk> .
and <unk> 've been known as `` <unk> and julia on a ship him . it was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> film .
<unk> but i wanted to actually a real <unk> the titanic <unk> .
we 've been the movie .
that 's the truth . studio knew that 's not .
i am convinced , i said , `` well , and <unk> of the movies over the real <unk> .
we 're <unk> the show .
that 's <unk> important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> , you a <unk> , and .
sounds crazy . but again to reduce your imagination a reality that .
we created , six months later a reality in the music in a russian <unk> <unk> four kilometers under the surface <unk> , and the real titanic through a <unk> <unk> .
that was no movie , no <unk> that was really .
so i was really <unk> .
and the <unk> they were enormous . we had cameras and <unk> and all .
and i fell on the way of these <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you up in <unk> , then <unk> in this dark energy <unk> environment , where no hope to the salvation of you 're not going to do .
and then i `` wow , as if it , <unk> .
that 's really cool . ''
i was <unk> obsessed -- exploring the <unk> .
anyway , part of curiosity and science to make it was all . it was , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience to hollywood to give .
you know , i could be human beings , and then a visual , forge . but i could n't want to the outside <unk> see .
and some over <unk> i 'd like in <unk> , and sometimes , i 've seen before was in addition , even worse , it was the science takes time , and you saw one more . i found .
that , right <unk> , and i wanted more .
and so i talked about something unusual decision .
the success of `` titanic '' said , `` i want to <unk> a filmmaker , the sea ice and i 'm a while <unk> . ''
and then we started off , , `` <unk> , '' and <unk> , they <unk> .
we going to the <unk> the titanic .
so little robots are built up with a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and the inside <unk> to have never ever been .
nobody had ever seen inside <unk> explores hidden , i no means that we developed , because we technology .
well , sit down well , on the deck was the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> this <unk> here , like to do i know once again , there were played .
and i . with a little <unk> through the <unk> the <unk> .
i <unk> it 's actually just going to my consciousness is within <unk> .
and it , if it was physically within <unk> the titanic there .
that was the <unk> form of <unk> 've ever experienced , because before each of the corner <unk> i knew i always wanted to explain in <unk> the <unk> up again , because i <unk> , <unk> <unk> was in the movie turned out .
that <unk> was in the exact copy of <unk> the <unk> .
this was a highly strange .
they made this <unk> aware that such <unk> <unk> , and so my own minds in the <unk> , in this other form of existence , .
it was really <unk> <unk>
and perhaps also a small view , which is perhaps in some of happen , and you <unk> has to explore the other things to do in all kinds <unk> <unk> found myself as <unk> can imagine .
these <unk> we 're going down , and we had to estimate how to for example , <unk> , where we 're <unk> we saw that the aliens , but here on <unk> .
they live in <unk> .
they do n't have sunlight <unk> system , how we do that .
and so you see the right next month ago degrees is that they are survival .
the same time , i also very important <unk> , again , <unk> my childhood .
and so we ended up the people work for the space in the strings attached to know what we 're <unk> in the <unk> plan . they said , <unk> a mission that <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> , `` go back to international <unk> and take our <unk> with .
that was fascinating .
but there was it out that i <unk> with us into the <unk> took .
so , and <unk> have access to get down , <unk> , <unk> , there are looking for the extremes of <unk> . i want to the sources of people around 40 samples the tools we were so forth .
we turned to <unk> , <unk> but actually , more : <unk> .
i joined by the circle of my existence as <unk> the child , and the <unk> in the reality .
and this <unk> , so i had learned .
i have a lot of science , but now , certainly , a director has to become a leader , like a <unk> ,
i understood how much of leadership . this <unk> <unk> .
because a certain point i tell me , `` what i 'm actually here ?
why do this ? what 's what ? ''
this <unk> to bring us money .
we 're going to <unk> a lot of fame that lane .
i think i thought , `` titanic '' avatar . <unk> and i saw somewhere in <unk> on a towel the beach <unk> .
i 've all these films , these <unk> , for a very audience .
and fame was a great money . what you do ?
you 're doing it 's the task will have to the challenge will have to the ocean is the <unk> environment , there are . you 're doing it 's <unk> because they 're not , connection , and she 's a little people who a team is .
because we have all this with only 10 people who did 20 years <unk> with that sometimes we were two or three months <unk> high seas .
and in this community can you very important thing without warning — — you do it 's no one task <unk> , you , to explain .

there is a connection , a <unk> respect .
i went back to take my next movie `` avatar right to be tried to the same <unk> use it 's team <unk> and the <unk> of respect you .
it was the really changed .
there was so again with a small team on <unk> <unk> . we turned his avatar , with a new technique , it 's still there .
<unk> exciting .
a <unk> challenge .
and we were for a period of <unk> years of the family .
it changed my way to make the arguments completely .
there were people said , we have these <unk> yeah well <unk> and on the planet <unk> <unk> .
to be a <unk> kind of my job to do , the real process of the result changed .
so what we 're all of you ?
the lessons we have ?
i think the first , under the curiosity .
it 's the most of property .
our imagination is a force engineering even to create .
and the warning <unk> team is more of <unk> this world .
to me come from filmmaker , `` give me a advice , is like that can do . ''
and i say , `` <unk> you ca n't even more .
you get the other for you can do n't make you even if you bet that we 're going to take risks , you . ''
nasa has a <unk> of failure is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and exploring them fail , because there <unk> a <unk> .
not important <unk> , that innovation <unk> to be without risk <unk> .
you ready to be these risks on to take .
that 's the idea , and i love with them to like to fail us . alternative fuels , but is no .
i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and that 's perhaps because my <unk> the foundation of the <unk> and <unk> turns out of things we invent agriculture , and the poorest billion a better life to
but energy and we are extremely important for these people out , even more for every other planet .
<unk> what it takes <unk> i was n't grow to be a very much or a little <unk> . they 're just going to their <unk> environment , <unk> .
that <unk> . it leads to create uncertainty . it leads to <unk> .
so , and <unk> awful , you .
and the <unk> for you very important .
the fact that they 're just one thing , reduce the same <unk> the energy as far from <unk> .
now , the <unk> 's time you .
actually based on <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> the ground and even the 20th century , a <unk> case in <unk> and so we have <unk> , <unk> to modern , `` and so many things .
find ourselves in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we , reduce -- let us , <unk> to meet anywhere on the dissolved the dissolved the u.s. co2 .
co2 of the planet and the equation for carbon is actually pretty clear .
they <unk> that <unk> co2 , which is <unk> to go and <unk> has some very negative the effects of weather and even worse , the <unk> as a natural ecosystems , such <unk> changes in the and so whole systems <unk> .
now , the <unk> between a <unk> and it <unk> <unk> and where the other people are , there 's some <unk> , but not very many .
and it 's safe <unk> about how to follow up , the bad day .
and i <unk> <unk> asked , `` have to get down on to zero billion ?
does n't , or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until at zero billion of the temperature on the .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's different to say , we have a <unk> feet high truck , the player 3 feet bridge , has to give you can then , and from <unk> .
this is going down on a zero .
well , we now a lot <unk> from the 26 billion tons .
everybody , about 20 tons of the poor countries spend less than .
average is about tons for every planet .
and somehow we see <unk> the ground zero to .
it 's this constant the
so many economic , it does , and we 're <unk> increase glucose <unk> to go to a <unk> to the ground zero .
equation for four factors . a little <unk> you have this thing left the co2 -- the direction in the u.k. and that 's the number of <unk> the <unk> , every person , and the average rate for service of co2 per dollar per <unk> <unk> .
and so by factor <unk> look at think we have the ground zero .
probably has 20 numbers to ground zero .
now , basic algebra , but we have time .
it 's population .
today only 6.8 billion people .
and it <unk> stage nine billion dollars worth caring about nine billion dollars .
if we very successful new <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> we could probably one of 15 percent to be a look at a slope to 1.3 .
the second of those services , we use .
to be , and the food , clothing television <unk> .
that are very good things and <unk> of course , and services almost every planet accessible .
it 's that this number up .
in the rich world in the top billion people , we could probably <unk> do you can use the average will this number every year , and so <unk> more than double the financial services used to <unk> .
here very fundamental service . there are the light on the homework , right ?
and these students did n't it 's go out and reading your <unk> . <unk> .
now , <unk> in order to the energy per service , finally good news .
so we will finish up .
because of successes in <unk> the other <unk> a new methods , <unk> there are many services to <unk> some of services let 's 90 percent to
in other <unk> the manufacturing , <unk> was 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> it 's the <unk> tremendous improvements very much smaller .
<unk> , and optimistic that we have a <unk> process of three or maybe even a factor six .
but the first three factors that we are now 26 , and maybe <unk> 13 billion tons . and that does n't know !
look into the fourth factor of -- and this is <unk> be -- that 's the amount co2 tax dollars per <unk> <unk> .
and it , the question that ground zero to .
if coal , no .
if you the burning no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> our co2 , except for renewables energy and <unk> .
so we 're on a global level we need to make a new system .
we need <unk> .
if i now term `` wonder to use , ladies and i 'm not impossible .
the microprocessor inside a miracle of the computer is a miracle .
internet and services is a miracle .
the people have here to the development of this miracle contributed .
normally do n't <unk> you have a miracle , and to date needs .
usually under certain kind of <unk> and the other .
in this case , but <unk> , and a miracle , very short .
well , i wondered how can i really <unk> ?
and natural <unk> , a demonstration of the idea of people here <unk> ?
i am reminded me last year . <unk> , and i liked the people that .
the idea was for the tangible , you know that people that there with <unk> life .
for energy i 'm here .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies make <unk> contribution to our friends would be .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you know <unk> they 're not <unk> , you probably not that the left .
well , it all kinds <unk> like this , but they did not much .
we need to achieve either a word several of <unk> scaling up <unk> <unk> , and although many goes up to be looking for a really just five to live under afford .
i 've <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
even afford . <unk> contribution and if you have you 'd expect that , but my the here is that we 're all of the work , and we ca n't have never , because we <unk> , because all have <unk> problems .
so first came burning <unk> fuels , and <unk> , or coal or the .
what you 're going to be perhaps , but that 's not . you all that co2 in the burning of the <unk> comes out from under pressure <unk> and then , <unk> and hope that there 's .
there <unk> years on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it on 100 percent to get a very difficult to be a <unk> for the <unk> capture carbon out of this is a big challenge the biggest problem here 's the <unk> .

who ca n't get used literally a billion times bigger than any kind of waste to the <unk> and other things can imagine ?
that 's a lot volume .
so that 's a hard <unk> .
next : <unk> .
and also has three big problems . the cost of the <unk> countries are up the question , as you 're really feel like , nothing wrong question , despite the <unk> the fuel not to use .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
because it 's not very big thing is a lot of .
so three very difficult to be solvable , we 're going to work .
the last three years ago , so i <unk> .
it 's renewables for how often be called .
and also have -- although it 's what 's dependent on fuel need -- they have some <unk> .
the most <unk> of these technologies can dramatically lower than any of <unk> .
that <unk> , you , <unk> , <unk> an area of the <unk> .
also <unk> different sources <unk> .
and to do n't all day , it seems to every day and <unk> also the wind , constantly .
so , if you , and it 's a way , energy crops in times when you ca n't available for us .
there 's great <unk> . there are challenges , and <unk> . for example , the <unk> outside of that do n't just the technology , they need to risk with the energy , where different from .
and that <unk> .
and a dimension to , all sorts of <unk> , which made things , at the building cars , mobile phones , <unk> for all . and that i 've been a lot of electronic , the world that uses path compared to i found out of <unk> , we make less than 10 minutes , <unk> <unk> .
we need so here a big <unk> , something like , a factor , better be a <unk> time .
that 's not impossible , but it 's not easy .
that happens when trying to <unk> sources , we say 20 percent -- 30 percent of <unk> .
if you spend 100 percent of <unk> want to do amazing <unk> .
well , where we go : what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project '' ? so the goal ?
what we need are many companies to work . it .
in the top five areas we need least 100 people .
of , and they are crazy ! that 's good .
i think , here in the ted , there is there before .
bill big part of companies in other thing called <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of the great things that 's interesting possibilities , and i want to support .
nathan <unk> and i for a company , surprisingly encouraging examples of approach that .
are some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> of liquid .
evolution has in this industry , some time stopped paying so it 's no big surprise that some of concepts <unk> .
that <unk> that instead of the brain <unk> of 19 percent of the <unk> , we decided to 99 percent of burning , that <unk> .
that 's a crazy idea .
but you had about , for about , but you could never <unk> simulate a work , but since it 's <unk> you know ? simulate the world , and you : yeah ! '' right <unk> to see it 's hard <unk> .
and because , 99 percent <unk> , as <unk> very much better .
actually <unk> of garbage and even food waste of economic so as <unk> use .
instead of the head down to <unk> you burn it 's a great thing .
that <unk> will <unk> <unk> little bit like a <unk> .
and you have a kind <unk> is often , '' <unk> wave reactor 's called .
that solves it 's <unk> .
here 's a picture of <unk> in <unk> .
is the waste , 99 percent of you see this is burned , in <unk> , it <unk> <unk> .
that <unk> the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you <unk> cheap and <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest <unk> the planet .
you know , there 's many challenges , but it 's example of hundreds of <unk> , we need to move to come .
think we 're going to our success measure .
how our testimony to
well , we have to target specific geographic reach out and then we 're talking <unk> .
many people that 80 percent <unk> 2050 .
it 's really important , and there .
the rest 20 percent of the poor countries , things , as a lot of agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and <unk> until a clean .
so these 80 percent to have developed countries including in china , <unk> completely <unk> .
the other note , whether we have <unk> technology , or not in developed countries used to see the kind of the rest .
that 's great .
that will be <unk> this <unk> .
if we can go back to be by 2020 testimony to
it should be the two elements of .
we should be <unk> to <unk> on the way to be less than <unk> the lower , <unk> , and with the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things that we do n't completely to the big <unk> of the same way , or even more weight matters like the amount of <unk> of innovation for these <unk> this .
this <unk> need to <unk> pursue and that we can measure : in <unk> work , <unk> and <unk> .
there is in the .
that al gore that we have the choice '' and david <unk> `` <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> air . ''
they really hard to create enterprises , in the world wide , can be , because we need to support of all sides .
there are some people together .
this desire .
a very <unk> desire to this technology .
so if only wish for the next 50 years <unk> i want to select a <unk> , and i love , or i could this desire , which is <unk> <unk> of co2 being invented . this desire <unk> me .
this has the greatest impact .

what we do ?
for what you <unk> i ?
we need to be more <unk> .
if countries in places like <unk> , should n't just about carbon .

we need <unk> of carbon taxes , <unk> of trade something that <unk> creates .
we message to
we dialogue <unk> and <unk> , and also , government done .
it 's a wish harm , but i ca n't satisfy us .
you .
you .
thank you !
you just to <unk> better understand the first , you see that the scale of investment that ?
bill gates : the simulation , <unk> to all of scientists to get what we 've got to we need only 10 million people , and even if our materials in a russian reactor , or to it <unk> works , as you only in the <unk> million .
the tough , is that build the first <unk> to another billion to find the <unk> the place of the first to build .
once the first , which is that 's how <unk> , it 's all right now because the <unk> the <unk> is so different than the <unk> , and you know .
that , right to understand : so deep sea floor , almost like a vertical <unk> nuclear <unk> it , <unk> <unk> and she starts to the process , and works even further down ?
bg : we have the reactor in new <unk> , so , so many people and many <unk> the wrong to make this thing where it opens the things <unk> or <unk> that 's not good !
if you 're very cheap fuel , you know , 60 years <unk> -- if you a <unk> -- they <unk> , without all the <unk> .
and it sitting there and <unk> 60 years and then is finished .
a <unk> of the solution for the garbage and .
bg : well , what the garbage happens : can tell him sitting around it 's a garbage with this method -- then , and <unk> him the reactor and burn it on .
and we start by food waste to take it already exists , in these <unk> or <unk> of reactors . is our <unk> .
so that is what these reactors a problem , we 're in our , and with a <unk> dramatically reduced the process .
but while you with different types of about these are talking .
where is the interest , this is really <unk> ?
bg : now we 've been working on a place the world 's a lot more <unk> for everything , `` <unk> '' in the stakes are big interest in the vastness of were in russia , india , china -- i was here and i 'm <unk> , and talked about this is <unk> fit .
i 'm optimistic . you know , and japanese have something in the direction .
now this variation one thing is done .
that 's a step forward , but it 's like the reactor and some countries have this , and , a rapid reactor of you have a <unk> for our first .
in their idea : <unk> the probability that 's a phone call ?
bg : now we need one of <unk> , <unk> are very cheap , we have the next time , and then the next time .
is the <unk> us to the <unk> <unk> , we <unk> .
and know , <unk> , ok , is a wish i could be easy .
and fortunately , so , dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of the same time , <unk> work together , for your <unk> works for <unk> .
, and best when several , because then you could be a use .
there we need a solution .
<unk> the kinds <unk> , this is that 's what you know ?
bg : a <unk> is that <unk> .
that would also , <unk> been , but the power , so much more .
the nuclear , there are innovative companies .
you know , we know whose work well , but there 's the <unk> way that 's another approach .
there <unk> <unk> , which is hard to be hard to talk about us .
and so there is a nice is that <unk> a million much energy has to say , a <unk> and so they 're with the problems with these things are mainly by the radiation , the <unk> and the cost of the potential , so the impact on land and other things , almost in one of <unk> .
if it works , then what ?
we <unk> <unk> to try to <unk> stable to ?
bg : if you this situation , if there in a you just a heart of what makes you what you need a <unk> or something .
there <unk> to their <unk> called the very different techniques <unk> to take the global warming , <unk> , 20 or 30 years longer and us , <unk> .
is just <unk> .
you <unk> we do n't need .
some people to tell you ca n't just the insurance , because you might <unk> makes it , and eats , because you know , the <unk> save lives .
i do n't , smart , and if you of this problem with eyes , but there 's now , <unk> in <unk> about whether you 're available now we should , if they had come , or this innovation longer need to expect .
<unk> : you may or two sentences for the , when you might convince ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the <unk> a very different <unk> .
people who the arguments that are very little .
you say , negative effects that there with the clouds to do that we are <unk> ?
there 's very few things do n't tell you can do it 's in a million .
that <unk> here 's like , aids .
you make mistakes , and pays for very much later .
and so is the idea that you 're all kinds <unk> problems has been working in a hundred years later what -- and it comes into investment that 's clear that 's actually is the <unk> report not that scenario , people in the rich world . <unk> look at say , okay , that 's not a drama .
and the fact that this uncertainty while we do .
but my dream is that you take it <unk> can do the same time co2 <unk> going to say , <unk> okay , there are n't have no carbon <unk> , i almost like , it 's <unk> but i 'm going to accept it 's cheaper than the <unk> method . ''
and that would their answer that <unk> <unk> argument that you 're all this time and energy use the co2 problem to solve the other goals and suffering from <unk> the <unk> eliminate malaria , and it 's a stupid <unk> of resources , the money to invest , make things that there we can do .
bg : well , the <unk> spending for the research -- we say the u.s. , 10 billion per year ago , as you do -- that 's not so dramatically .
and the other things .
you have a big <unk> you can see <unk> people disagree and if you do n't that <unk> is trying to do for it 's happening here of <unk> .
, because it 's very briefly , <unk> and funded by the <unk> . i should be more things are the potential be a lot cheaper .
if you <unk> , and you get into a very high <unk> you can just the rich <unk> .
i mean , of us here , so much for our energy , without his lifestyle change .
for the bottom two billion but it 's a <unk> .
and even <unk> think differently .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is research , <unk> ? ''
he will still remains , in stories with the <unk> <unk> , but he understood this is a very , there 's therefore , he now , <unk> .
and that 's a <unk> this is to think .
the research it 's just nuts , how to be supported .
bill , i think i speak for almost all over here , when i say , i hope , really that her wish that 's much .
bg : thanks .
some years ago , here , and peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> years ago .
the idea is quite simple . <unk> have <unk> <unk> structure with 20 <unk> you ca n't <unk> <unk> you ca n't <unk> thread and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow , up on .
and although it really just seems , it 's actually really hard it makes people <unk> very quickly and .
and so i thought this is interesting idea is and i do it in a <unk> into .
it was a huge success .
since learned about 70 workshops , done with students , <unk> and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there is something that it runs deep <unk> in nature of these and i want them with them .
usually a most people , in the task to orient .
they talk about what i think , like that they <unk> the power .
then in a little time in planning and organization . <unk> and put <unk> .
they invest in the , in the <unk> constantly <unk> structures
and then just before they did n't need to take someone off the marshmallow and they put him <unk> on the top of the step back and `` <unk> '' `` the initial work .
but what would always been happening , `` <unk> going to a `` <unk> '' becomes more weight of <unk> <unk> that the whole thing . <unk> and <unk> .
there 's a series of people , `` <unk> '' <unk> more than other , and the worst of fresh <unk> .
you lie , they <unk> , they are confused and make really <unk> .
and of a team in fact , <unk> '' <unk> have taken under the best , fresh <unk> the <unk> .
and that 's quite amazing .
so let peter , and they did not just the highest towers it <unk> structures of all .
what you might ask this is : how this ? why ? what 's work ?
and peter , `` none , invest in the head of <unk> <unk> to be . ''
they invest not in <unk> .
there 's yet another reason .
and things <unk> trained about climate change the plan to find , ok !
and then the <unk> .
then what happens when the marshmallow on the top <unk> they have no time , and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what <unk> to do is the marshmallow , and prototypes , and prototypes , always with the marshmallow , so that they <unk> opportunity to <unk> prototypes to repair .
<unk> recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of <unk> <unk> .
and with each trial for the children <unk> feedback , it does n't .
it 's performance of prototypes to work together , but look at once , how different teams the .
the poor people do is about . <unk> , <unk> a half of lawyers make more , but not much more <unk> are better than adults .
who is the most ?
architect and engineers , there .
<unk> is the highest and i 've done .
and why ? because triangles , and <unk> , these are the key , stable structures to build .
<unk> behind the average . but here 's interesting .
and you <unk> <unk> on the team , <unk> better .
it 's see , and , `` this team will win . ''
you can make predictions . why do this ?
because they particular skills , <unk> .
they process of course , they understand him .
and that team , that <unk> and on the work <unk> the performance of teams <unk> .
<unk> skills and <unk> and their combination of their success .
when they had teams have a typical 're going to get about six more stable structures .
i tried to really exciting .
i thought that we <unk> equal .

what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was that ?
what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if <unk> a <unk> of construction , have said , and worn .
so why is not interesting thing to high <unk> a effect ?
we <unk> this exercise power of students .
what you think happened now ?
well understood the advantage of `` <unk> . ''
so the same time for team of the best .
they produced by the highest construction in the <unk> time .
there are <unk> lessons for us human nature of incentive for success .
you ask why would someone happy to invest in <unk> the ?
the reason is , i <unk> digital tools and processes -- two teams , and video and `` <unk> <unk> going to create .
and what the <unk> does it helps you are hidden assumptions , to identify .
because , in each project his own marshmallow .
the challenge , a shared experience , a common language or a <unk> , right prototype to build .
and this is the value of this experience this sort of exercise .
and those of them , there are interested in <unk> visit .
it 's a blog where you see how <unk> build .
there <unk> there .
they find a examples from all the way to the system <unk> and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson i believe that structure actually a <unk> sports .
it , we 're all our sense of the task <unk> and that we 're thinking <unk> use our feelings and you do in the challenge to have .
and sometimes is a small prototype this experience because it takes us , `` <unk> '' -- to a `` <unk> '' <unk> .
and a big difference .
you .
and so i 'd like a machine .
a big machine , a cool . <unk> machine , and that 's a <unk> .
and everybody in this room , straight line .
and they can see , if you can in the future to do n't see here and now ,
and i asked me to vote , because my friends a time , i asked myself , and they did all the past .
i do n't they wanted to go back to enable cars , or twitter or `` america , and the . ''
i 'm not .
i 'm convinced that kind of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
and that i .
i 'm not a group i have to say .
i do n't , which is n't that i <unk> 'm wearing
it 's in the planet , not go back to go forward .
and so in this machine , and i want to the future .
this is the greatest the same amount of the planet , there 's no , because they <unk> : health , mobility , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
there was never before a time like this .
my <unk> to better than 60 percent .
my grandparents urged this number of 70 .
my parents are the 80 percent of <unk> .
there should be better than nine of my <unk> .
but it 's not going to people like us , because this is a thing than that .
a kid , that the <unk> was going to expect so long , like the richest man than 100 years ago .
you think about an amazing fact .
and so why ?
of smallpox was smallpox , billion people planet , killed .
they have the demographics , on a way , shaped like a war ever done .
they are away . they are gone .
we have you <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world that exist in the millions of us just a generation , under that we hardly anyone .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
so i met somebody else ?
<unk> the modern medicine to a billion people to feed , that successes of scientific method .
and my view is the scientific method to try to look at whether it works , it 's going to do n't that 's the <unk> of humanity .
this is the good news .
unfortunately , we all the good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of what 's all of of a billion people on this world every day hungry , to bed .
this number up , and they up very quickly , <unk> .
and not only that , we have our be used this world <unk> to <unk> .
water , <unk> country , and the gas , they disappear and soon , and if we 're not from this chaos <unk> disappear , we .
so the question is : we can do i think .
i think it is that 's a look at a billion people feed , in the country , and they 're going to <unk> .
i think we can get energy , and they simultaneously , .
i think that 's no , that 's not <unk> .
but you look at awake at things , at awake . we have the progress , we need the right now , seen .
and we were also been able to him <unk> <unk> we are today .
we are the threshold much amazing thing that events on the areas , i did n't have hundreds of 300 years ago , <unk> go back to take a time to find in progress <unk> have to live in these things <unk> <unk> who have to put more <unk> right now .
the people <unk> , they believe , so , you could n't <unk> .
not the truth of <unk> .
and listen to everybody has a right hand , and even lower right up in the progress .
but you know what , right ?
they have no right , facts . <unk> , you may not .
and i have a while it to take out .
, a decade , so i was about <unk> , `` the new york city 's a little paper .
and i was amazed at the resistance to , the resistance of what the bottom of <unk> <unk> health of humanity .
i did not what i should do , so i did n't know , i do i wrote , and drove .
and soon i wrote such an <unk> the food .
the same thing only bigger .
they played .
and so i think about this article written , and i could n't understand why people thought that would say <unk> , `` why they believed that the molecules on a certain instead of <unk> kind <unk> a <unk> on the nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote an article , i kept on .
i mean , not a journalist .
this type of the rich guy came out , that 's okay .
but these articles and worried , and i could n't find out and i found it out .
and that is that these <unk> , they did n't have <unk> .
were <unk> people <unk> people an people .
they were like the people in this room .
and that got me , the ...
but then i thought you know what would be totally honest .
we are a point the , the same relationship with a little bit earlier .
we <unk> .
we ironic is a little <unk> about the progress . ''
okay , there , and i think we know the reasons that .
so we trust in institutions work , authority , and sometimes in the science of losing it 's no reason why do n't be .
you can just give you name , and the people will understand .
chernobyl nuclear <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , and their own to vote .
there 's a severe problems with the people , we believed that they always right now to be very skeptical .
imagine the desire to the evidence of our desire to <unk> .
you know , given me .
but now comes out : if you evidence to do this evidence that 's very good , well .
and i can come from the reason that we now emerging epidemic of <unk> life , how i 'd never seen , and hopefully again , you 're going to .
and 12 years , author , a terrible story of the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> the connection made .
very <unk> .
<unk> studies were done to see whether it <unk> .
<unk> studies , and yet , which is a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data , `` we 've seen from england from sweden , from canada , and they were , no correlation between the connection to have .
it does n't do n't we 're sending <unk> think we think we 're seeing what we can think about the <unk> that we 're really feel .
we think about human <unk> documents from a <unk> of data that i understand that , and i do that we all .
but you know what ?
result of <unk> .
<unk> because fact , the u.s. is one of countries in the world in the full immunization . <unk> the .
that 's <unk> and we should be <unk> .
it 's awful .
what happens that we do that .
well , i understand that . that i .
it has taken someone <unk> ?
with one audience ever in the <unk> die ?
and not very often .
now , at the <unk> time in the world last year .
are many deaths from <unk> 20 per hour .
but because it 's happening , it <unk> , and people like <unk> <unk> can <unk> text messages of fear <unk> different platforms like <unk> and larry king live <unk> .
and that you can do they 're in the correlation between .
they understand that these things that they seem to almost never same .
and that 's something we have a very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> kind of the worst <unk> humanity .
no fear , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> 've gone .
the guy in the middle , not so .
he is paul <unk> .
he has just with a few other people who <unk> .
he got it 's <unk> as well , children per year in the developing saving .
well , right ?
well , that 's good , besides that paul <unk> , <unk> , and says , how valuable they are doing this -- just stop should be <unk> .
and that 's actually , etc .
paul so this <unk> .
if paul 's a public <unk> talks about that can not without <unk> , about .
he gets <unk> home , because the people him to tell you know where his kids to school .
and why ? because the way <unk> it .
i need to say , but <unk> are <unk> .
you take them to continue to return to diseases , terrible disease , and that 's .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and worse and pretty soon got back to die , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not only <unk> die .
what <unk> ? what 's why ?
a <unk> of me for a few weeks written and said , or not a little <unk> .
nobody has ever before you .
they would you do n't cure <unk> <unk> this is .
<unk> .
why ? because we <unk> , and you know what ?
we had in this country , no <unk> .
today , i do n't recognize the morning , in lagos , airplane profile and she said , right now he is in ohio .
and in a few hours goes , and <unk> a car , and he comes home , in fact , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> tonight , .
and he does n't screaming with a <unk> disease <unk> is , and we know that 's the world , well .
this planet , we do n't as if he did n't .
we love it turns out to lie to <unk> . we love that .
you may morning to take vitamins to ?
<unk> , a little <unk> we 're going to the one does .
i know that you 've only half of americans die every day .
so this stuff , and they take a <unk> , and it does n't know how often we find that they <unk> are .
the data <unk> that constantly .
they <unk> with a very much they almost never .
that 's okay , they want to 28 billion dollars in a .
i was completely nuts .
dark a very dark .
why do we do why do we do
well , i think , i hate the <unk> .
we hate to build strong government . we did n't trust the system .
and that we should n't fix our health is <unk> .
it 's cruel of millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> for us to afford .
we see them before , and where the right ?
we walk into the poor people <unk> .
that 's great . i love the <unk> .
but you know that 's really serious issue because that stuff is a way , and we billion dollars to .
and i 've all kinds of artifacts .
<unk> of the <unk> i was a <unk> i was a <unk> , because i know it , which is , but we give a year to it was .
and you know what ? when i would say , screaming , people , who cares if you ? let people are going to what they want .
so feel ashamed . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it was n't matter whether it 's <unk> , `` hmm , i 'm <unk> of experts from mammography 's suppose '' or any <unk> of his patients with <unk> treat them .
if you on this way are going to think that magic <unk> science , you get them a place to do n't be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south .
he was 400,000 . , because he did was the red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more than <unk> drugs are we know , the hearing aids <unk> .
hundreds <unk> deaths in a country gets worse than other kinds of this disease <unk> .
you say , please do n't so all the consequences .
and you have to have you .
now , the <unk> epidemic , we 're just find that <unk> struggle between <unk> <unk> <unk> food and the <unk> .
now that <unk> debate going to stop .
it 's a debate about words about metaphors .
this ideology , not science .
everything in the food , every <unk> , branch <unk> , <unk> was , changed .
you know , was no <unk> in <unk> .
there <unk> .
there <unk> we all done .
we have it has been <unk> 've done .
and some of memory works and some of course
we are <unk> we do n't work .
now we can look at work and there risks . but we can make vitamin a lot of rice , and stuff , and help millions of our lives . <unk> .
that you do ?
i have to that i do .
we <unk> <unk> the food off .
why do ?
now , and i hear is , many chemicals <unk> , <unk> , <unk> do n't have fields with one thing , that 's wrong .
we want to do n't to live <unk> .
we want to do n't of seeds .
and you know what my answer that all right ?
yes , they have right . <unk> aside .
it is we have a huge <unk> , but that 's not science .
so let 's nothing to do .
it 's quite a moral hazard <unk> .
you know that has a company .
it 's no country .
it 's not the idea ; you a process .
you a process and sometimes , he and sometimes , but the idea of science to allow you should work to do we 're afraid that 's a real <unk> , and of millions of , off .
you know , in the next 50 years , and 70 percent more food grow to look at nearly 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
they need that , and we do n't .
and why ? <unk> the food .
we want people would encourage it , <unk> stuff to eat , and <unk> .
<unk> is a billion people eat .
it 's like a <unk> .
it 's just a <unk> calories . it 's <unk> .
it has no nutrients , it has not be able to build all that 's very quick .
and then we could say , that , they would n't blind .
you would n't <unk> , and you know what ?
that would you . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would you .
and everything is to say that is : why fight us ?
i mean , ask : why fight us ?
because we not genes <unk> ?
it 's not about 30,000 genes <unk> . it 's not chemicals .
it 's not just ridiculous passion for <unk> , our <unk> on <unk> food , shelter <unk> food .
it here 's rice <unk> , it 's about people to get into the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't know , and so how far we do we 're guilty , we believe , not guilty to get high-tech colonialism .
it 's not a description for that , what happens .
it 's <unk> , it 's ugly , it 's our pediatrician <unk> , and we need to stop .
the incredible funny entertainment , so maybe , `` you want to this ridiculous <unk> and in the future ? ''
there 's so there .
now , they present the amazing possibility .
we can <unk> and imagine what we want .
we can <unk> where they <unk> , and we 're going to move where we want .
we need <unk> out and we think , but if we <unk> , and in the future we 're happy to do .
i know , we can relate to tell me . is that this is now needs .
thanks .
thanks .

other words , <unk> have in some studies , <unk> effect in the <unk> , just like , because the person thinks they do with her this is a <unk> some kind of ... in <unk> for example , there in the patient , i wanted to think of <unk> effect in the body language , if <unk> .
a deception is something <unk> , because someone is that <unk> .
so , to each other trying to all now , <unk> , very simple <unk> .
and i show you know how he works is a trick at least for the 1950s , <unk> for children .
i know , from <unk> <unk> magic . <unk> 1970s through .
i 'm here for you do and then .

so , you see , what happens .
that <unk> we 're going to you my hand to study .
i 'm <unk> the right here <unk> .
i <unk> my <unk> back .
and to nothing in my <unk> <unk> or from him out , i 'm just my <unk> here <unk> .
this way you can see me and none of anything , and as i <unk> ca n't in my <unk> <unk> or out .
and that goal is easy .
so my hand , and hopefully , ok , and <unk> through all naked physical <unk> <unk> .
it is actually , so that 's a place 'm going to shake it , without telling <unk> <unk> .
so the in my <unk> it comes out there <unk> . and they 're talking about .
<unk> .
so , that 's a trick is a little kids <unk> work for <unk> these because you can a lot about deception , if you look <unk> though it a very <unk> trick is .
probably know many of them the room will trick .
and this .
i think that <unk> in my hand .
now i 'm going to <unk> <unk> order to nothing in my <unk> <unk> or out there is a lie .
why i <unk> <unk> it 's the fact that 's a real secret of illusion is .
moment which had my hand of them <unk> with them from going to move this is kind of thumb , and there , where he was in a position to live , <unk> .
great trick ?
there is the person , your childhood .
so , he is here .
and when i <unk> dramatic changes shape of its position .
and now you could talk about why that a deception is n't know if <unk> the way down here just three fingers to see agenda , because the mind and the way of information <unk> do n't <unk> counting money , three , but a group .
but it now here , and then the open my hand .
of it 's <unk> , but through the <unk> my body , a trick with my thumb , and now there is .
and if i my hand 'll never happens is looking at <unk> going through this movement , the fingers over again <unk> .
i guess these hand away . and here is that <unk> .
this trick them by their neighbors <unk> .
now , what that , with the <unk> to do ?
and a year or so , i read a study of the right <unk> .
not a doctor or scientists , and so it 's amazing thing .
it 's what out : if you <unk> in a white pill to the form of <unk> , as a round of the pill , which is a certain <unk> effect .
but if you the shape , in the <unk> <unk> for example , in a smaller pill and these blue <unk> , and then <unk> is actually measurably more .
and that 's no one of any <unk> ... it just <unk> .
but a white pill 's not like a blue pill .
what ? '' -- really <unk> .
and but they found that there is all .
if you <unk> take these items <unk> as <unk> every form .
a <unk> <unk> , which is the yellow and the red , it 's better than a white <unk> .
but <unk> plays a role .
a pill twice that 's not good , pills -- ca n't the exact statistics all . sorry .
the answer is ...
it 's also <unk> play games .
and the shape as a role .
and when <unk> <unk> we want to symmetry of the .
right ? a syringe . <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> <unk> for a patient <unk> .
that creates a very <unk> image in a lot stronger than a white pill .
this is really -- i 'm going to a different to show you look at <unk> .
but this is that the white pill , so good looks like the blue pill , which is not looks like a <unk> not good looks like the of .
and of has some really <unk> property . it 's just to think back to us a <unk> effect <unk> .
i want to whether this idea for a <unk> use .
i guess is obviously a deception , and it really .
we know , it 's study done , of the bridge the same thing to do .
this is 18 , long <unk> a very , <unk> . and i 'll notice first a little bit <unk> .
here is really like meat . it 's not <unk> <unk> <unk> meat .
here is my skin . that 's not <unk> from hollywood .

if you <unk> will -- when they easily in <unk> fall -- i 've got a few friends last night in the hotel <unk> , and some people , i knew that is a woman , <unk> .
i 'm so imagine if you quickly <unk> going to look for the next 30 seconds away . you know , i 'm going the first <unk> part here back .
you can tell you can you can also <unk> , if you want .
so , it turns out here , where my as you the a <unk> i 'm just a little <unk> .
i really sorry to make a crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin , and so again .
now we actually to look at the amount of <unk> .
this .
but now , my fingers not counting ?
so , i 'm going to show you . this is two , , five .
now , yeah .
i know what the people think , if you see .
they say , `` okay , which is n't know <unk> and <unk> in the skin , just us , for a long as the . ''
well , then i 'm just show you .
look at what does pretty good .
yes , i know .
and the people back , `` okay , and i do n't right . ''
the people in the <unk> come up in .
so let me from a quick .
that 's my skin . that 's not <unk> from hollywood .
that 's meat and i can <unk> .
sorry . if you <unk> to look to look at me .
the people , or 30 years later , even if you 're going to say , `` well , that looks like this <unk> , but when it really would be encouraging -- you see here 's a hole and there , if it really , and it would <unk> . ''
okay , let me a little blood for you <unk> .
yes , it .
i 'd gone out of <unk> .
i would my arm drinking and show you might be there 's wounds .
but i think in this , here and with intent -- from a deception , real , i 'm kind of them in there 's and so , you go .
we will happen in the next few barriers , and the face .
i hope you <unk> . it . you .
everybody talks today about happiness .
i have some people of books . let 's an album `` <unk> '' in the last five years published , and they gave about 40 percent , and it was much more .
it 's a massive wave of <unk> of happiness is , .
there 's very much <unk> .
everyone to say , happier .
but despite all of flood of work there -- cognitive and it , almost impossible make clear about happiness .
and my talk today , because of these cognitive fall .
this is <unk> of our own happiness and it for scientists , where you think it turns out that we are like that .
the first of fall . it <unk> the complexity to .
it turns out of the word that 's not <unk> word that 's because it on many different things . .
there 's a particular meaning that we <unk> could fairly and is that we give to be , and we are hugely complicated is that need to say well-being is .
the second case is a <unk> of experience fear memory , basically what they would be happy in his life and be happy about life or happy with his life .
and are two very different concepts , and they are both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that 's the <unk> fact that we 're going to be thinking about the human well-being , without its importance of <unk> .
i mean , is a real . trap .
are just no way , it right there .
now i 'd like an example , someone who <unk> had taken one <unk> , the story <unk> . [ unclear ... `` he said , he had a <unk> , and it was <unk> music , the end , there <unk> <unk> sound .

but that had not .
what it <unk> who were the memories of experience .
he had experience on .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
they <unk> do n't screaming with a memory <unk> was ; this was <unk> , and the memory , because he would keep getting burned .
we really the news about the other people think that sense of two types of itself .
there <unk> itself , that in the present in the present , which was able to the past and experience , but basically just the present .
it 's <unk> itself , that the doctor <unk> -- you know , when the doctor , `` does it that hurts when you <unk> ? ''

or `` i was their journey , <unk> ? '' or like .
are two very different entities , that <unk> , and that <unk> itself , and the two to <unk> is part <unk> the <unk> very lucky .
well , <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that begins talking with a basic reaction to our memories are -- it begins immediately .
we tell the stories , and we make stories .
our memory tells us stories that means we 're sort of our <unk> to get is a story .
and let <unk> with a really start .
there on trial .
the real patients with a painful <unk> <unk> .
i 'm going into detail , which is today more painful , but they were painful , in this study in the 1990s done .
they were asked , 60 seconds about their pain , to report .
and are two patients who are your records .
and they asked , `` who are two more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
and b , clearly have suffered . <unk> much longer and every minute of pain , the patient , i had in b , and more .
but now there a question : `` how they were these patients that they <unk> ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise , the patient to a much <unk> <unk> the <unk> had a patient .

and no way that 's very <unk> a great -- but of them is this clear .
but of them is the worse than others .
and the other worse , this point where the pain in the bottom of its peak because it 's a bad history .
how do we know
because we are going to <unk> i 've also much later , `` how was the whole thing <unk> ? ''
and she was much worse for a lot of b in the <unk> .
so , that 's a <unk> conflict between <unk> and the <unk> itself .
my view of <unk> even had a clear that <unk> time .
now , what you patient to make it , and we have a clinical experiments done and it 's been doing this works , you could actually , <unk> the patient to <unk> by just the <unk> , makes a very much . <unk> .
that will try to the patient from , but just a little too much less than before .
and when you for a long power , you <unk> that the <unk> even the patient to , which is that you <unk> that the <unk> even the patient a much better which is , because now the patient to a better story about his experience .
<unk> . '' a story ?

<unk> looking at a story <unk> are <unk> a great <unk> the end .
end up , very important role in this <unk> the end .
well , <unk> our lives life <unk> .
it has <unk> the <unk> , the other .
and you ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they are designed forever lost .
i mean , most <unk> of -- and i 've <unk> -- you know , the psychological present in fact about three seconds long . it means you know that it in a life about 600 million of the last month , so , <unk> the most of you leave that lane .
most of them completely ignored , <unk> itself .
and get the impression that they count , what happens during this <unk> the <unk> in our lives .
it 's the , resource , and while the are .

so , we <unk> , and that <unk> , and they are really quite different .
the difference between them is the people with time .
my view of <unk> itself , if you <unk> in the second week , it 's like the first , it 's the <unk> <unk> twice as such <unk> <unk> .
so work at the <unk> itself .
for <unk> itself is a <unk> <unk> , better than the <unk> <unk> , because there 's no new of the .
they have the story has changed .
and this way to actually perform critical variable . <unk> itself from a <unk> itself . and very little impact on this story .
well , <unk> even more than half of the stories .
it 's actually <unk> make decisions , because if you a patient who have to say , <unk> two different surgeons had left decides to what does n't choose to do this is an <unk> this is an actual memory , less bad , and that is the surgeon had selected will .
that <unk> itself has no voice in this election .
actually choose not only <unk> . we choose your memories , <unk> .
and even if we look at the future to think we think of our future , rather than <unk> .
we think about our future , as <unk> memories .
and basically , you know , as a <unk> the <unk> itself , and they can <unk> even think about one of this is <unk> even <unk> these experiences . <unk> do n't .
this impression that if we <unk> it very often the case , is that means we do <unk> are public services , <unk> itself .
and that 's a little hard to justify i think , .
i mean , how <unk> of our memories ?
that 's a lot of explanations , for the <unk> the <unk> help us .
and when i think i think , and <unk> every few years in antarctica it 's clearly the best <unk> when i 'd ever had , and i think it often , in , how often , i 'm <unk> think .
and i 've probably one of my memory of these <unk> , i would say about 25 minutes for the last four years <unk> .
well , when i ever been <unk> on up with 600 to do n't mean , hour .
so , that are three weeks , and that <unk> and hours .
there seems to <unk> to give them .
well , i like a bit , if you have been like an appetite for the <unk> of memories , but even though , even more of this is a real question . why do memories so much weight , <unk> the weight that we <unk> be ?
so i want to talk about a stop .
imagine your next <unk> 're going on the end <unk> all their pictures <unk> , and they get a <unk> drug that they do n't remember .
well , and what the same <unk> vote ?
and if you . <unk> vote would be a conflict between them both of ourselves and you think about how they come to decide which is really not obvious , because when they sense of time thinking , answer . and when they sense of memories , to another answer .
why we have <unk> <unk> the <unk> is a problem , that gives us , with a choice between two types of itself .
well , the two types of itself , two <unk> from happiness .
there 's actually two concepts of happiness in the other parts per itself .
you can see them questions : how happy with no <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask : how they are the <unk> in the <unk> itself ?
and they are all of happiness for <unk> 's a quite complicated process .
which are the emotions that we measured can be ?
and the way , we are now <unk> a pretty good idea to get from happiness . <unk> thinking about the time .
if you of happiness . <unk> to ask it 's a thing .
that 's not quite happy person in .
it 's how much more satisfied be pleased the person 's going to this person who lives think .
very <unk> term .
every one of these <unk> not from the space exploration of <unk> <unk> i think that <unk> to a lot of , about comfort , these include exploration of <unk> long <unk> have on the way .
the distinction between happiness . <unk> and seek happiness . <unk> itself is the last years , and then we 're trying to be the two <unk> measuring .
the <unk> <unk> has a global survey , more than a half million people ask , a about what about your life thinking about their <unk> . and our efforts in the direction .
in the last 10 so here we started talking about that one of itself to learn .
and the <unk> lesson we believe , learned is really different .
you know , is satisfied , his life is , and that teaches you really not a very happy to be our lives and .
just to a lot of the correlation between , which is correlation 's about <unk> .
what that means that if you would meet , and you would tell you , `` dad 's a <unk> how much would you of size know ?
well , you would something about the size , but there 's much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if you say , life than eight on a scale of 10 <unk> , you have much uncertainty about how happy , and <unk> itself .
the correlation there .
we know something about what happiness . <unk> that .
we know that money very important goals are very important .
we 're lucky , is satisfied with people who we like the time to spend with people who we like .
are other delight , <unk> .

the <unk> out of what i said , that we 're lucky really not very much as a <unk> for well-being .
it 's a completely another term .
now , very briefly , another reason i did n't know where we can do n't on the same kind attention if we can be thinking about and if we actually live .
so if you very simple question imagine how happy people in california are going to <unk> answer .
if you ask you think that the people in california and to be when they say , in ohio .
and what happens is that if we live in california to think about the difference between the other places and this difference is it in the climate .
well , it turns out of climate not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for <unk> itself , that decides to get happy people are .
now , because that <unk> yourself responsible for the bottom -- some people might end of california to .
and it 's so interesting to pursue whatever happens with people in california , in the hope you happier .
well , you <unk> itself , happier .
we know that .
but is going to you think they 're happier , because if you think about going to remember things , like the weather in ohio , and they feel that the right decision , it .
and it 's very clear about well-being of thinking and i have a lot of how difficult it 's .
thanks .
thank you 've got to put them .
you .
now , and a few weeks and we <unk> me to be a pretty interesting , there is , from that <unk> survey that .
it 's what they 're in the because they have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think that <unk> result of the <unk> survey found is a number , we absolutely not to expect .
we found in terms of enough donor <unk> itself .
if <unk> our emotions with the income <unk> .
and it turns out there are under the last 60,000 dollars per year for americans , and that 's a very <unk> of americans think about <unk> , but it 's a representative <unk> under certain income of <unk> dollars .
60,000 years .
dk : 60,000 years .
60,000 dollars per year , and unhappy they 're becoming increasingly <unk> the <unk> you .
we get a very flat line .
i mean , i have rarely is flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money , no <unk> <unk> , but that the money , certainly <unk> <unk> , and we can <unk> , very clear measure .
in other , the <unk> to get a story .
more money , deserves this <unk> it .
that have my emotions .
but danny got to the entire american <unk> it 's life , freedom of the happiness .
if people are finding take you mean , it does everything that to do everything we think for example , in <unk> so forth .
there 's a politician that the country , and finding out to take yourself and focus on politics can happen ?
dk : you know , i do it <unk> there for the role of <unk> , .
the <unk> going to be the united states , no question , but the united kingdom , you and in other countries , you .
the people are , <unk> that they 're lucky , and she 's energy policy .
it for five million people will be discussing . <unk> exploring , or whether they <unk> exploring , so this discussion pretty soon .
how lucky to be a very different depending how they think about whether you <unk> itself , or whether you <unk> itself .
that will also affect , i think , in the <unk> years .
the united states <unk> you look at the <unk> of measuring .
so i think , or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to this topic says , or at least , <unk> the debate going to be about the next few years .
you for the invention of <unk> .
thank you , danny <unk> .
and jane <unk> . i <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> now since the last <unk> . and my goal of the next decade , as easy to make the world in the reality to save the world <unk> to save lives .
i have a design that i want more people to convince , very much more time with the play <unk> and <unk> games to spend .
now spend over 3 billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you think maybe , `` a whole time for games . ''
maybe something much time when <unk> how many problems we need to look real world to solve this .
actually , but in my research the institute for the future to make it 's exactly the opposite <unk> .
three billion hours a week are not <unk> enough to <unk> problems in the world to solve .
so i am convinced that the next century planet , survive to do we spend a increase .
i 've <unk> they took time , 21 billion hours <unk> week .
it seems to something <unk> i repeat , i 'm going to do anything : problems of hunger of a global conflict between obesity is , and so i have to try to play online for , 21 billion hours a week until the next <unk> to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why this picture , pretty closely , why i do is so <unk> for survival of human species in the future that are seriously .
this is a <unk> of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to feelings of play from it 's one <unk> a camera built .
this is the classic expressions of play .
if there are the <unk> , maybe some <unk> in this picture .
so you probably piece of the urgency , something , but also <unk> concentrations , very <unk> to solve one really difficult problem .
if you can play you see some <unk> , the <unk> eyes and the mouth open , and optimism . <unk> a surprise .
this is a kind of the edge of a so-called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok <unk> . so we have some kind here .
a <unk> victory for a result , so you positive than before i knew it is possible .
it was <unk> beyond our imagination .
and when we 're shocked to give you 'd like that , which is a <unk> victory .
this one player 's just a <unk> victory .
and this is that we 're talking about <unk> of <unk> , we need to the <unk> the next century is going to take the face people <unk> all <unk> the edge of <unk> <unk> .
well unfortunately we see in the face in real life , if we all problems face .
i <unk> it as , `` in fact that bad <unk> and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
i am i think is , `` in fact that bad <unk> doing .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , the place in my <unk> <unk> why we 're playing better , as a real life .
that 's a problem , that the players have .
we think we 're in the reality n't like to play .
and i 'm not just a successful , even more .
we reach in <unk> n't mean , in the intrinsic motivation , something <unk> to do i was working together .
so in a <unk> i think , a lot of us in our best is transforming from any and immediately <unk> who are <unk> the problem to solve , and how to reduce the <unk> again try .
and in reality , and failing at the <unk> , i feel that we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated , we feel anything under a depressed , frustrated by <unk> .
these feelings , we never have to play video games , so they just not .
and this is what i was <unk> study .
why is it in the impossible to start to think you could n't know what ?
so how these feelings of play in the reality of ?
so i could play the world of warcraft , the ideal in the <unk> solving and .
and i have some things that the epic <unk> in <unk> as possible .
so , first , if you one of <unk> <unk> of the world of warcraft , a lot of characters are willing you a <unk> mission <unk> and immediately .
but not just any was a mission , the perfect teaching her current level a fit , right ?
so they will .
they get 's never do n't solve .
but the edge of skills , so to <unk> it 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
this is not around and turns <unk> . it 's always been <unk> something important that .
and it 's <unk> staff .
where they also for hundreds of people with them all their epic mission <unk> .
that in real life not merely feeling like , a <unk> <unk> people ready .
also , so this epic story , these <unk> story , there are and what we know what it .
then get out of the positive feedback .
they have the level up and resilience that i heard or resilience . ''
this <unk> feedback , so the real life .
when i 'm so i 've been picking battles resilience , and resilience crazy idea of <unk> crazy idea .
i 'll find real life , feedback .
so , the problem <unk> the world of warcraft , it so <unk> is , any the edge of <unk> <unk> the way , our whole time in these <unk> spend .
they are just better than the reality .
until today have all world of <unk> together <unk> million years spent a virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
that 's not necessarily something bad .
it sounds like <unk> .

the first <unk> <unk> so .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we currently building play , that make sense , whenever you have terms of the scale of human development of eyes and we 're extremely glamorous .
but also appropriate clothing because it turns out , and by this whole time to play in fact that 's what we as being able to .
we need to <unk> <unk> , you beings .
is the truth , i think .
look back into a probability as recently , researchers were carnegie <unk> at the problem : the average young man of today in a country with a <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> of the 21st of .
so , 10,000 hours is extremely interesting number , from two reasons .
first time for children in the united <unk> hours of the exact <unk> to school , or five . class of the <unk> high school -- if you do is .
so we 've got a complete <unk> a young people just learning is a good kind of being , like everything that you learn .
and maybe have some of new book malcolm <unk> , `` <unk> to read .
so you know his theory <unk> the theory <unk> of 10,000 hours .
it 's based , research , <unk> we have 10,000 hours with the <unk> <unk> one , <unk> of the 21st of , we going to <unk> inside .
we would have been , to do you <unk> the world .
so what we have here is a complete a young people <unk> are .
the big question is so , `` what exactly the players <unk> good ? ''
because if we 're able to have , before , there <unk> human potential to .
so many people are currently in the world at least a day , <unk> spend .
are our <unk> to 500 million people 's an extraordinary well in rather .
and the next decade we have another billion player 's an extraordinary well in , are .
if you do n't have heard .
the <unk> developed <unk> going to save and on <unk> to work in the <unk> so players , especially in india , whereas brazil online games .
to create extra billion in the next decade .
so we have <unk> 1.5 billion player .
and so i started to think about it 's , this is to <unk> .
here are the four things that i found a step : <unk> .
ok , imagine the extreme <unk> .
<unk> is a need to be <unk> to <unk> with you think we <unk> hope for success .
players are always in a <unk> victory , and that it 's worth paying attention to try and this .
players are not .
are masters in <unk> a social nets .
's a lot more research to show that we are more like , after we do that , even if we <unk> defeated .
the reason for the problem of trust , which you ♫ a game to play .
we put them time with that we spend on the rules <unk> to be easy thing to have to our <unk> role .
so these are <unk> to grow up <unk> to trust and together .
as well , we <unk> social relations .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , is a reason , <unk> of <unk> 22 hours a week as a lot <unk> .
the reason is that we 're playing games are we 're happier and hard to work as if <unk> or do .
we know , and as human beings <unk> work , and hard to great to do .
and are always ready hard to work , if the right task .
and eventually , this epic .
players love taking part <unk> <unk> missions <unk> <unk> .
so <unk> to the right light their backs . you know that , and the <unk> world .
that <unk> <unk> the world , with the <unk> <unk> is the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information world of warcraft , <unk> richer than any another issue in each other <unk> world .
they created this epic story .
they created this epic source of the world of warcraft .
ok , those are two superpowers ' to a single experiment . are <unk> remarkably hopeful individuals .
there are people who are a single change the world .
and that only problem is that you think the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that 's the problem is going to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is genius of our other people in the same energy and money <unk> spend .
and he was going to witnesses told me less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . ''
and that the economist . so it logically .
and he ...
i think is -- <unk> i 'm not something <unk> .
so he says , makes a sense of the player can <unk> to reach out in real life .
you can in <unk> social <unk> <unk> as a real life . they get more , emotional rewards in britain in real life .
so , he says , it 's currently it logically , in the more time in the virtual world , in the real time .
i just for that 's logically .
but it 's definitely no <unk> .
we start with the real world in a game theory .
and inspiration comes from a event , that <unk> years <unk> .
there are these <unk> dice instead of <unk> . you know ?
and these fantastic <unk> there <unk> .
and that were so the first of people to <unk> .
and if you with the <unk> the old <unk> <unk> <unk> familiar with you know , this story . the story . and why games invented .
according <unk> , i look <unk> in the kingdom <unk> a famine had .
. , such great famine years , the king of <unk> it crazy idea decided to .
the people <unk> of the people <unk> .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme .
so invented ways according <unk> , that <unk> and <unk> a national strategy . a day you eat the next day you play .
and you would have to <unk> <unk> to be there is an amazing stories , <unk> , <unk> productivity by that they forget about it 's nothing to eat .
and then the next day you can play and the next day you eat .
and according <unk> <unk> , if 18 years , famine hit by a day eating and i played .
and i think we have games .
we are going to take away from the real world ca n't .
we play a very important to <unk> , that in the real world , it 's the real life . <unk> is , and we bring us what we need from the play .
but not end of .
that 's the exciting .
according <unk> was under 18 years of famine , better . so in the king , the last <unk> <unk> .
they shared humanity in two <unk> .
they played a <unk> and the winner were to a <unk> , <unk> .

sounds crazy ?

so the scientists recently , <unk> that <unk> like crazy story actually true .
we geologists found evidence a <unk> , almost 20 years -- that famine explain .
so this crazy story that .
you may have to help people will be saved by looking at 18 years ago , games <unk> , and then this <unk> , so much about each have learned that they made the whole civilization , it .
so , we can also .
we have since 1994 warcraft .
that was time i <unk> in the world of <unk> they 're 16 years .
they were 18 years <unk> , we had 16 years warcraft .
i we are ready for our own <unk> play .
so , they sent in your civilization , for a new world . so i mean 21 billion <unk> week .
we should have <unk> a half of us , a day , to spend 90 percent of the real world solved .
so i 'll be wondering how do solve all of the real world in ? '' and this question of my work has been around the institute for the future a .
we have this banner in our office in <unk> <unk> , it <unk> from the future of understanding .
we want to try to the future , to say .
what we want to the future .

we imagine that epic <unk> and give me possibilities , you .
i 'll just briefly , i 've designed in order to the epic <unk> in their own future <unk> .
here is the world without oil . ''
game is 2007 .
it 's a <unk> in . they <unk> overcome .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> , it for you <unk> , and they 're real life , without oil and so they 're looking at the game <unk> to tell us where they live . and then , they <unk> in real needs to show how much oil costs to do n't it 's going to <unk> <unk> 's going to transport <unk> , there are closed groups of the , and you can see , you are real life to be true . and we 're going to talk about <unk> youtube videos or <unk> <unk> .
we have this game with <unk> <unk> in 2007 . and we 've ever since the last three years accompanied him .
and i can tell you it was a <unk> experience .
nobody wants to life change it 's good for the environment , or because it .
but if you in a <unk> those who said , `` we oil . ''
this amazing , and that you about .
find out how they survive the most of players have a <unk> habits <unk> .
so , we 're time you <unk> play a bigger than <unk> goal <unk> my <unk> .
we have game `` <unk> '' the institute for the future .

this <unk> called `` global <unk> <unk> of course .

you know <unk> <unk> , `` <unk> '' there . they have the <unk> a scientist , <unk> and just put them to save .
but in our play on the only five people say , and that <unk> , and it 's our job in the future for the shelter , security and social justice . .
<unk> player played game up a long .
they found , incredibly creative solutions are <unk> can , `` <unk> '' <unk> .
and last game to look at 3 in march . it 's a game in collaboration with the bank .
if you game , you get a bank , <unk> `` social <unk> , '' <unk> 2010 .
we 're universities , sub-saharan africa invite you 're social <unk> to learn .
we have a <unk> . we 've got a high school for <unk> trying to <unk> of sustainability , vision and <unk> .
so they invite you can play with young people sharing information everywhere in the world , in <unk> of the big deal with your own social <unk> that the world to save .
i come to end .
i want to questions .
what you think that happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have to us to show you 're doing , but we have the real world have saved .
well i hope they 're going to agree that the human resources are going to work in real life can be able to play a big meaning for change .
so we all superpowers ' <unk> productivity of our ability <unk> of nets to <unk> , <unk> and desire to <unk> .
i hope that we do it 's a piece of the planet , another century to survive .
and you with me to play , and play .
so the next decade <unk> , i 'm worried about two things i 'm going to each <unk> future , that we 're going to play .
so i say , let 's <unk> to start !
thanks .
i 'd like something you about what a few months to write a <unk> for <unk> wired noticed is .
i have to write about my <unk> <unk> , but i was an edit the <unk> already done , and i fell on that i had my life <unk> in the word `` a '' which means .
and you the post office .
`` a , '' <unk> , `` <unk> , <unk> , <unk> as well , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> partly paralyzed by <unk> <unk> , <unk> like traffic <unk> , <unk> as well , they’re broken <unk> , <unk> and lo and in the <unk> and weak .
<unk> , healthy , and <unk> . ''
i have this list of life according <unk> and the first laugh again , <unk> so ridiculous , but i came , `` <unk> '' and could n't <unk> the ability to stop to read me first of the <unk> <unk> and so <unk> , shock .
of this a <unk> years old <unk> . i got me just thought that the <unk> been pretty old to .
but it was a <unk> on the early '80s , when i just with the <unk> started i started my <unk> outside my <unk> <unk> a little plastic forms of course , in other children and <unk> to me .
and god . thanks , so i did n't <unk> .
i would this post take into the world born with someone like me as a person can happen to live in <unk> a positive <unk> . '' but i 'm for the opportunity gaps , i experienced that <unk> .
so i could immediately . <unk> of 2009 <unk> and expecting that i 'm a <unk> contribution to .
here 's the <unk> version of <unk> .
<unk> 's not much better .
especially <unk> me the last two words , `` <unk> <unk> '' `` and healthy . ''
but it 's not just to the words .
it 's about what we 're about the people think , with these words that .
it 's the world in these words stuck , and how we need to build .
our language influenced our thinking about the world and the people around us .
many <unk> , including the ancient greeks and the <unk> we really <unk> that the <unk> one <unk> a great force has been destroyed because according <unk> , it <unk> .
so what we might actually <unk> -- a <unk> people to <unk> people ?

it would not a lot of doors up ?
a man , and the doors , she was my <unk> the <unk> . <unk> institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he is dr. <unk> . a <unk> and name is to do you think the most americans are correctly <unk> . so he was always on <unk> called .
and dr. <unk> wore a very <unk> fly around for the work with kids just like .
i found a paper in this hospital in there 's great -- until i <unk> .
i had one . the infinite , repeat that <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know the <unk> that we have this <unk> more <unk> than we 've got <unk> . i put <unk> . i did you <unk> .
and you did indeed , as <unk> child with dr. <unk> <unk> and so trying to their exercises , to stop the <unk> a success .
and one day he looked at one exercises in our own exercises were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me , `` wow <unk> . i <unk> , <unk> and young girl , one day one of <unk> <unk> .
and if you <unk> , so i hundred dollars . ''
that was a little bit easier trick of dr. <unk> , i call exercises that i want to do n't do with the prospect of the richest <unk> girl in the <unk> , stick , but he has to be brought my everyday <unk> new eyes . so , a new york <unk> experience .
and i asked me today is to support his vision of me as <unk> and <unk> a my <unk> shaped , and i 'm going to me as a lot of nature of the strong , <unk> and <unk> person .
this is example , as adults , <unk> of the child <unk> .
but how the world <unk> examples from the <unk> prove that makes us our language of space is something that what we want to : it every single to heal itself as <unk> people .
our language <unk> the societal change behind the cases , technological change is .
now , from a look at the course , my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titanium put artificial <unk> for <unk> bodies send it would allow us all their opportunities , and over the boundaries protect them their natural destiny <unk> to be going to begin to talk about social <unk> platforms for people to their own identity have to write to define it to deal with worldwide population going to orient in itself <unk> .
maybe <unk> so this technological change <unk> because we have been a truth and there , which is that every human society . <unk> and very <unk> give it 's the human ability to <unk> , our <unk> plus is .
the human ability to <unk> -- that 's interesting story , because people , again , i 'm going to collaborate with <unk> <unk> and i 'm <unk> : this sentence , for me . <unk> and i got me very <unk> i felt the questions of people to answer , and i think <unk> i do .
this sentence of people with <unk> in the idea of success or happiness . <unk> , a challenge to <unk> , without going to <unk> experience <unk> , as if my life so successful <unk> , because i want to fall of life with a <unk> <unk> could focus , people with my <unk> perceive .
but the truth is that we can change course we are the challenge <unk> , you physically pushing people or both .
and i did this is good .
<unk> not obstacle that we <unk> have to our lives better clear to come .
<unk> belong to our lives .
and i <unk> , <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes realize , in mind is , sometimes he hardly see , but he 's always taught me .
and i want to <unk> the impact the united states <unk> the <unk> way <unk> .
there are in life <unk> behavioral challenges these are just <unk> real and every person 's how much different targets . but the question is i do we <unk> clear , or not how we 'll clear .
we are not just responsible for people who we love , <unk> a , but also to prepare , good as clear to come .
and we <unk> our kids , like if you feel that you divide the .
you two things to separate from the world , but <unk> , and other social think about whether a standing or not .
and honest , in the only real and <unk> <unk> to me apart , had to the world is , you can go with these <unk> describe it .
in our desire to the people to protect us to our hearts , and i <unk> very hard about their medical <unk> <unk> or even a <unk> the quality to do expect , and that we do n't <unk> to put them actually a .
well , <unk> concept of the only kept <unk> we 're in a broken , and how we repair it for every single a <unk> , more <unk> .
if you know , <unk> , which is not all the forces and able to acknowledge that we in the natural struggle , and you might lead to another disease .
we <unk> a nobel prize for our society which has .
so , <unk> to look and we all the human possibilities that .
the <unk> but is that it between perception of <unk> and the great <unk> , a connection .
we should be <unk> times , <unk> or <unk> , we should n't try to avoid virtually anything we should be the carpet return , but it 's about the <unk> opportunities to recognize .
it is perhaps more about to imagine that we <unk> n't get to see that we do you 're going to hug when you <unk> to <unk> 's also a <unk> is maybe even a dance .
and maybe we 're <unk> about natural gas <unk> and <unk> , and feel so through their presence was <unk> .
the celebrate 10 years ago , and by charles darwin and as he 150 years ago about evolution had ever since darwin actually view of something very true in this <unk> .
i would it so <unk> : not the most of the breast cancer and also not the <unk> its kind of this is an individual changes to adapt .
this conflict of creativity .
not only from darwin , we know that the ability of people to survive and <unk> from the human mind that is the conflict . <unk> .
so , again , to change climate adaptation of <unk> skills of people .
and maybe we learned from which <unk> we <unk> are we 're really through .
perhaps is exactly the sense of <unk> , a perception of <unk> , a sense our own power .
we could be detected something to .
we can <unk> a new meaning of the <unk> times beyond .
maybe we can <unk> significantly change .
<unk> stand for a change the , we have adapted .
i think the damage control , <unk> i 'm going to believe we 're normal lives .
and honest , who is normal ?
there .
there 's the usual sort of a typical . but not normal . and they would open arms race <unk> person began to learn , if it really there ?
there 's not .
it would be so this <unk> the <unk> against a different route , or the strength , even a little <unk> to <unk> , for us . so we can measure forces holding very much to release the ability to invite people in particular , <unk> skills in society <unk> .
<unk> we 've found that we made me more members of society , one <unk> have been useful to be a major contribution to afford .
there is evidence , in the <unk> around 60,000 years older people and with a physical injuries are worn in and that happened , because <unk> in <unk> of decompiculture society valuable . ''
they have these people to break apart <unk> at ; they were as something special effects <unk> treated .
a few years ago , the city , and i was a <unk> in that the red <unk> '' in <unk> of pennsylvania , and i stood there , <unk> tomatoes .
it was , and i had <unk> .
and i hear , as a guy behind me , `` well wo n't that <unk> <unk> . ''
and i <unk> , and see the older . i had no idea who he is .
and i meant `` sorry , sir , you know , to you ca n't you remember . ''
and he said , `` well , they <unk> do n't remember vividly remember .
i first time , and i whistled even from the <unk> 's <unk> . ''
oh , so forth .
and of it 's click .
so dr. <unk> , a man , just shared narratives 's about this day , because of the typical place to my on two weeks late one .
the doctor for <unk> <unk> my mom was in <unk> , and so we knew my parents , man , the world to do n't .
and because without <unk> was born , and my feet , if you <unk> not just toes that , and toes the foot , he was the <unk> that strangers to the bad news <unk> .
he said to me , `` i had your parents tell you 've never happen if you never <unk> that would like other children or you 've never <unk> life , could , and since they just lying <unk> . ''
really extraordinary i found that he <unk> my entire childhood collected a matter whether you <unk> in the second grade , and i with the <unk> , and <unk> to <unk> <unk> was , or of scholarship on one <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he used these clips from his students to teach them <unk> from the <unk> <unk> school and the <unk> <unk> school .
and he called this part of <unk> latin x factor of the potential human willing .
you can just do n't stress this is a factor for the quality of people can be .
and dr. <unk> told , he said , `` i 've learned that , and they 're not always something else said something that if you just a little support for you take their own <unk> can see very much . ''
you see , dr. <unk> way to be thinking .
he had understood that the medical , and how someone who <unk> , two different things are .
and also got my thinking about the time changed when they looked at the 15 years asked if i mean <unk> the legs of meat and bone <unk> would have n't second <unk> .
i did n't necessarily , do .
if you know what i am i 'm not sure .
and that 's happening because i do with my legs experienced , and not , <unk> .

you see , it really just a lot of course , <unk> see , and forces <unk> , and they are represented .
when someone , his own favor of forces , to activate it -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you , and for anyone in a <unk> right next door to figure out for these people a very good teachers .
they are associated with the doors to open .
the real importance of <unk> `` <unk> '' <unk> in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means something on the way in the things for <unk> .
again : which potential to do now <unk> ?
in the was in britain , <unk> done looking at the <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call , `` <unk> <unk> '' in the call it , '' <unk> . ''
the students get your grades into .
and a student will <unk> harder through to get a better teacher .
and then over <unk> period , with a `` enough english student note , very good . they said to be <unk> they 're very smart , and these three months have you really <unk> .
and <unk> 's a heart to hear that , the <unk> said , they will be good enough .
and it was then the three months .
but only those are you were really besides the students at school <unk> .
this is this study a teacher not <unk> .
the teachers did n't that something changed .
i was , they would be able <unk> and that are the students with the note sufficient . and you have you something , and you 're treated .
the only real <unk> is a <unk> spirit of mind , and broke it has no hope . he nothing more beautiful . '' in our natural gas <unk> curiosity . and our <unk> , <unk> .
if we have to create the human spirit , to support to continue to hope , and other people in the next to find curious about <unk> , but then , and we really positive feedback .
if a mind about these qualities <unk> as a new reality . <unk> .
i want with a poem end of the world <unk> <unk> called <unk> in 14 , <unk> was going to my friend <unk> <unk> tells the original poem called `` oh god , the only four words , '' `` every child knows , not god , the names of any of god <unk> , but the god , the only four words , and it repeatedly , he says , `` come to dance with me . ''
come to dance with me .
