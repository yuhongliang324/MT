yes , good afternoon , ladies , and gentlemen .
so you for the up here today to talk .
and i have to me , now there .
my name is christian <unk> and i am , even term , <unk> the city .
that 's called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : one personnel to the organization , and the public policy .
so i mean for <unk> that city responsible .
and yes , you do n't have to popular .
i know .
and beyond , and that 's something which my son , particularly like , i 'm also <unk> .
so , i 'm the head of <unk> department .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and yet , i think that 's kind of a subject matter that i want you today <unk> want .
because the subject of <unk> , because , that belongs to the department .
we 're on the best and they 're us on the worst , and that jack what once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then start i do n't quite as serious to say .
i <unk> you a position .
so let 's talk , if it a risk is that we 're about a disaster , for <unk> <unk> , an hour .
many people are on .
it <unk> , it <unk> .
and somewhere on the is a suitcase , lonely , leaving , a little <unk> , maybe <unk> with <unk> .
nobody seems to belong .
the suitcase 's no .
and a <unk> .
leave you <unk> .
police , fire , <unk> .
people are .
officials <unk> .
you go out .
what 's because it ? to ask <unk> .
so we know , not or we ca n't it .
the people leave the building .
children cry .
and fall in fact , because it all to go .
and a <unk> .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic breaks out .
i 'm here on .
the rest <unk> i your imagination .
but it 's not a fantasy , that i <unk> . <unk> ?
this is going on in this week is happening in <unk> .
there 's one of these suitcase be remained .
afterwards turned out that , in <unk> , nine kilogram drugs at it .
but people were so , and so has a friend told me that tells us , from the building <unk> .
it was n't say .
and it came in this <unk> all at least in the group on that my friend in my friend , was .
god , you is n't panic <unk> , otherwise would be the long not as benign out how it appears .
you see , in a <unk> , in a <unk> disaster , of a very important .
communication is that matters because the people in this situation where literally to communicate <unk> .
they want to know what 's because you can go .
once in the good , the time , for the authorities , quite simple .
we 've just do n't have said , we 've got lied .
why ?
because the so-called <unk> was .
you , so <unk> to say , god , the people get to panic , because we would not the truth , we say the <unk> .
this is in a period of social media , in a period of twitter , in a period of facebook , in a period of the private and public <unk> , in a period of <unk> and <unk> television not be possible .
simple and <unk> so because it 's one of the moral , and second most are anyway , the past when <unk> that the event .
you remember , maybe even at the <unk> the hudson river , is a year before .
so the <unk> about it arrived at twitter .
from someone who 's on a <unk> was and just and <unk> immediately <unk> , here 's an airplane <unk> and we save the people now .
this was n't <unk> .
you see , we 're on it on , these simple and <unk> of <unk> the truth to say , very <unk> to find out .
because what we are of the past , supposedly the truth know , because we as <unk> need of course , to notice that we just <unk> information to pass .
it 's public media , or a private media 're not so much thought , they do it 's not .
and therefore , we 're going to eat , and that 's also something that even by the left , we think about how we 're in the future with <unk> deal .
and that we 'll be the good old <unk> back out .
but only as a form of <unk> .
so , we 're in the next few years about a hundred <unk> in the <unk> build that , some of you know that , <unk> , if it just for <unk> coming .
it was it with it .
you know , maybe you know , what times more quickly , once in short , a long and even just means .
i do n't know anymore .
we 're doing this is <unk> with all <unk> that we at this point , so <unk> , on facebook , on twitter , about the radio <unk> also look at night , about the tv and at all over the internet and the local media , right , of course , with <unk> to look at the information on .
and we know , we have been there are very quickly and <unk> operate and we have been there are very quickly and <unk> out , because the <unk> and citizens are not <unk> .
and we ultimately , no longer i believe that we say .
communication in the crisis , or in the event , so on a question of <unk> about all media that 's look at , and it 's also a question of <unk> .
<unk> is our biggest problem , because the <unk> and citizens , either , oh , <unk> once again , you do n't know , or they say , the <unk> us , it 's much worse than it in reality .
we have so as good experience done with facebook and twitter , even more recently .
also that you may be some of course , you the media from .
we have a <unk> to eat <unk> had .
and it 's one of chemical bomb .
these are bombs that with a <unk> with , because they should n't even have not the first <unk> on the <unk> explode , but through the houses in the world war <unk> and just the ground , because of a chemical response that are triggered is that a little <unk> that <unk> <unk> two <unk> from each other <unk> that 's <unk> , and then it came to an explosion .
the problem is just a lot of bombs 've never worked and they 're looking like to stand in <unk> among other things into food <unk> .
and we were asked by an older gentleman who will be some of how it as beautiful in the <unk> said , <unk> wanted , we now , he had seen as you <unk> <unk> know , and now <unk> he 's the authorities want to be that 's a bomb . laughter in
and since , several fact , reported in all <unk> .
we 'll see , what we have anything .
and bombs need to a place , not <unk> , but <unk> .
and so we then in <unk> park simple and <unk> one , in every sense of the word , a bomb <unk> .
and time in the history of the communications data on facebook and twitter , let the consequence of the <unk> far above <unk> <unk> total followed .
and the media was thrilled . laughter throughout the background .
we did n't even with <unk> , but the have <unk> and <unk> , all over <unk> and twitter .
it had a great effect for us , because the <unk> will <unk> increase over these social media .
and therefore , they have to me also a sign , when i stop .
i can go from here 's not at the clock look .
this is the <unk> therefore , because first of these social media the advantage of that you very much information to pass .
not so much <unk> , because the members who live there tweeting or the <unk> , you how she calls , a high <unk> .
secondly , fast <unk> .
if anything not true to write it 's immediately that the <unk> of i just talking , and goes up , because of the whole community in principle of the reports involved .
and it 's a very high <unk> therefore , so if something wrong , it can also very quickly <unk> .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> that what we thought , as a bomb on <unk> park up .
and so we learned from all the things that in recent years happened , and there are much more <unk> happens when <unk> a still remember , when <unk> one knows .
the city of food , every day of such a disaster home for .
a bomb , in <unk> to be in a park that 's certainly not such an .
but you can also , and then <unk> we now , in the <unk> found , and then i 'm so there with our <unk> and try and in seven meters deep <unk> .
and when the beginning to think about <unk> , think about other cities , and then <unk> to be , because they just a so-called <unk> , the you conventional n't <unk> , then we know already going to be a variety of houses , no more like this way before .
and that to communicate is important one because it just in one in a world <unk> <unk> speed necessary , communication to run , to me just going to panic to prevent to try to worry about to carry that the people to be , in order to worry about to carry that the people in the are able to look at these difficult situation put them .
and the social media help us as well , <unk> , because , eventually they all of communication involved , and it 's not just a <unk> <unk> is how we in the <unk> , <unk> and certainly , in the <unk> the big part .
of this is today <unk> not just a job of the authorities , not just a job of the department of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , red cross <unk> etc . it communication in the event and <unk> a disaster 's all of us .
and <unk> has it turns out .
there 's on twitter and on facebook , most of aid did , if it 's partly because you have to be overwhelmed , because of <unk> of any <unk> 're going to and you did not anymore where the <unk> .
this shows , there 's a lot to do , for the public communication in <unk> , but the unprecedented <unk> with the <unk> and the <unk> has just demonstrated that the social media from a <unk> , out of communication n't even more way to think .
and i hope that i want you a little bit about me , that this medium , yes , for the beautiful things of life often used to be in <unk> its meaning and purpose in and that we as a city , for the for the <unk> in charge , this instrument in the future , completely new and very different <unk> going to her , to the citizens to use the <unk> and citizens and end i now and <unk> me to welcome to their attention , if i the entire time barely seen .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , as you 're already .
and i 'm right now , that 's own <unk> of reasons .
what it is that i there <unk> 're going , that i 'm going to be equal .
before i 'm doing , i have but a few things <unk> .
the first is that , i think that we stories in order to life need .
that we have stories of life .
and i believe that there 's very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories , as the entertainment actually produced .
then i think , that the internet , the infinite , , and so well , how do n't <unk> really all <unk> .
and fourth , i <unk> that people to do it created , to be creative .
and you to be happier , once you may be creative allowed to .
the more people are happy , it 's the world .
it logically .
these better world 's now , just a byproduct .
in the first line is me , as i said , a storyteller .
and the story that i tell you want to start at midnight in a <unk> , just happy <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now get them from the <unk> and the singing not so much with , because the moment , where it at midnight become , is something to her .
it 's something in your head , in your body , with their perception .
and they did n't really words of that .
they do n't know , what 's just happened .
i was words of that .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see on the one <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and everything is quite a black .
i ' feel that i 'm sort of <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other hand , we have the two then in <unk> <unk> with a very much color .
and it was at this point first told that i 'd better <unk> and writing , when i used to record .
so , the first , what <unk> now with their new sense , is a <unk> man with <unk> <unk> hair , before she says , you very serious look , and thank congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> about that you to a very special kind of people .
she was as <unk> born .
players are people that off your <unk> age of their lifetime play .
of you know <unk> ?
very beautiful .
so , that <unk> at <unk> n't <unk> , if you each other , but <unk> from the bag .
so cube , <unk> , <unk> , all sorts of .
what really important , the players have n't have a glimpse of their <unk> .
we know , also not , when we die .
i wish that every a long life , but we know it just not .
it can also tomorrow 's been passed .
and and it 's in my players , so .
you probably not to how it because actually play .
that means again , every lost minute could the last thing to be .
a player , the entire lifetime <unk> , <unk> the moment of <unk> like a <unk> that <unk> .
now , you think of course say , if that because so it 's why do play and then at all ?
the answer is very clear : that .
without play , without the players to go around , <unk> , gray and only when a player 's , he 's actually alive .
they were to play born .
so .
this story of <unk> and you now the world of gamers <unk> to her first challenges , and of course inevitably in <unk> love , this is the story that i tell me .
and it in the form of <unk> .
so the season , twelve follow , sorry , i 'm here is a <unk> happens that i just too late 've seen .
so , twelve follow the first season with the length of each five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a after the other , you <unk> told that you know about .
the television has been his <unk> nothing else .
this is not new .

and not at here .
now we go but it 's go .
so again , <unk> back .
what 's the most of the movie or from the series ?
it can only one , right .
thanks .
as if we practiced .
and that 's on the player is not too .
of which is it 's lots of .
there are so many different games .
if you just to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , so forth .
and so <unk> 's also the number of players .
and and it 's a lot of stories that everybody tells you want .
now if the next question : who do this because everything about ?
i ' a very high think of me .
i took me for <unk> smart and extremely creative .
but i know that a hundred brain to produce more than just one , even if it mine .
so it was right to the idea that you have the crowd of the creative process <unk> .
what if we <unk> not just <unk> or give , but even <unk> ?
so if you say , we invite you very very welcome to the development of this <unk> with <unk> .
so , , for the result of three <unk> a <unk> on that you really great , because he put them for example of her grandfather of .
and they 're a giant fan of <unk> .
then they can now , with the present technology is that do n't even more so hard , a <unk> .
and this , they 're on the <unk> up , where it right , and that 's really cool <unk> , the really interested in the audience <unk> .
so , it 's not anywhere among , but it ends up the right there , where it up .
this really nice thing is that we the internet .
and the web , you can we do anything .
so , every medium is that allows us .
so , and when people you can write , drawing , spin , which , they do want .
and if we now , again this at .
it looks <unk> bit of <unk> net , right ?
so this <unk> , what in common set up .
and i 'm really <unk> that the internet was born , in fact that sort of stories to tell .
there are just unfortunately , not so many , or no .
so , now go ' i but even one step further and let the viewer on the players .
in a <unk> .
because you can the characters from the series go but also for people in the real environment , as these <unk> on your cellphone .
<unk> <unk> that you know about it also all very good , is something like mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this wonderful areas that are very rapidly evolve .
and that i do n't go , because i would just 20 minutes need .
we believe , together .
everybody 's time off of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we have the <unk> .
with this <unk> i could <unk> the jury of the moment , i have this to see , the <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
they have to the price for the best <unk> .
and i have to say , these jury made from <unk> by banks of <unk> , <unk> .
so reasonable people , you should do .
and if i want to convince , here with my : the internet is really use , <unk> structures revolutionize , by the world better , then i think , i can actually going to convince them .
so .
everybody 's time off , why does it because now ?
because it alone in this up all areas covered .
we have of course , first the <unk> , who is off , i 'm on , you 're off , everybody 's time .
and then they die .
in a series 's very much died .
everybody 's time it means : everyone needs to die .
and then , as well , everybody 's time on the sense of everyone can coming up , when he said it would like .
this is i really important .
i come on the <unk> and there 's nothing worse i think , as if it 's a <unk> .
i do n't know , if you know .
if you in theater , and then it comes the actor , in the <unk> and all this : oh god , please go to me .
and that 's just not .
so it 's volunteer interaction .
and nobody has to .
he can also just audience .
the reason i german talk is that it 's also in german will be the first .
this has also a few reasons .
i 'm with this project <unk> been on and i was again and wondered : do it but in english , demographic bigger , blah blah blah .
and i can just say , the german <unk> is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , it comes the spanish , and then the german .
it 's so now not so , when we 'd like us in some small <unk> .
and i really actually really , if it also other people that 's like me that people are going to for something that not by any <unk> <unk> , where the end then everybody <unk> and each <unk> <unk> .
if it 's walking , as i 'd like , then goes on the first of now the first <unk> <unk> online .
and if you going to ask why i because i 'm here in a <unk> , where it underneath the headline <unk> <unk> <unk> walking .
and i also a couple of thoughts .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also very much on the <unk> and <unk> .
some <unk> were also , and <unk> .
and i can really just say that all know incredibly important is and amazingly <unk> .
but it uses it 's nothing , it 's not <unk> .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just about everything in fact , what i 've learned .
and it applied .
and so what 's good .
i can really just say .
so , if you who thinks , i want necessarily have been my to contribute , i had degrees ' one idea <unk> character , i ' <unk> drawing <unk> cartoon , or whatever , it 's also now been .
you find ourselves in the internet .
on facebook .
great , like in the speaker .
yes , <unk> ' i also .
welcome welcome to , you can memories are wiping ?
question of them .
you can memories are wiping ?
can you because of all remember what , in your life ever happen ?
they 've got <unk> do ?
who has who can even at all remember that ?
it 's not hands up .
so you memories are wiping ?
apparently been .
thank you .
no , as simple , we want it 's what do .
then be the talk may be pretty soon .
again good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today at night , i chose , because he two of my passions , or my two big passions right .
i ' , here in the near <unk> studied and i ' i just with the bits and <unk> busy , which is the size of the world .
and <unk> some time i 'm going to a coach , consultants in private and <unk> field on .
on the one i do with the with the computer was very much more engaged , on the other , i 'm currently working on the in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so how does because that this is the human ?
how do you because that ?
the about a comparison <unk> .
i was recently in a very interesting conversation about artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was , when we can , when , when we can get a computer building , that 's like the human brain ?
so , and i <unk> ' there are we 've been pretty close .
so i think , so two , three hundred years , no longer does n't that anymore .
but let me to do , why you why this may <unk> bit of them .
so the comparison between the computer on the one side and our brains and on the other .
so the computer , then based , everything , so your smartphone , her <unk> , her <unk> and these cameras and all of intelligent refrigerators somewhere on <unk> little chip .
he 's called <unk> , central <unk> <unk> .
these pieces are fused together , <unk> transistors .
the word , i 've all heard and in <unk> it will always been so as a triangle this .
this <unk> little <unk> that has three <unk> and turns <unk> current through .
in our computer in our <unk> we have , i the extra <unk> about five hundred million of these little pieces .
and the turn this wild clutter .
we 're things , we do we can do , we had degrees ' of albert einstein tell you hear , <unk> computer can all can be very much , very quickly but it can just zero and one compare .
and he can not .
he 's actually quite <unk> .
we want to make it 's compare with our brains .
our brain has the smallest unit the neuron , the neuron and we have them , because i <unk> , a hundred billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in our gray matter of up here in .
the beauty but is , our our neurons are not only three connections , who have to <unk> each neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because it beautiful , is 10 trillion .
these are 10 to fourteen zeros <unk> .
so , because you see in the complexity of our brain is so much higher than that , what we are still a computer .
we want to the <unk> time now , perhaps the one or other people know of , the first supercomputer that had their own power next door , ha who were , and with the <unk> the <unk> was the campus <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> sometimes , but the box up here 's about 20 watts .
and the , and this is on the equivalent of two of bananas , so to do n't you and you your computer up there 's wonderful .
if we <unk> <unk> good part up here , <unk> <unk> a calculator with <unk> , why we 're going to do n't know , why do we then things ?
maybe you know the one or another these <unk> the web , so , the person 's only 10 percent of his brain , buying now this <unk> in order to <unk> brain .
and <unk> there <unk> the advertising a bit .
ten percent , perhaps , but our brain is yes throughout our evolution to this mass <unk> , that was yes <unk> smaller , in the middle , nor our <unk> with inside , everything else has <unk> formed .
it 's certainly not happen , because we do n't use .
why it and so that we have the part of <unk> let me ?
maybe you know , the term of <unk> ?
and i compared the walls and so beautiful with the iceberg , if you the iceberg , in the sea , is the top of the peak , it comes the <unk> , there 's a <unk> .
and these 10 percent up , this is that 's about this , what our <unk> , our <unk> mind , <unk> 's but <unk> percent , is a giant <unk> , <unk> .
we <unk> the thing we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> slow ♫ but we <unk> creative .
and to be <unk> on this memory back , maybe you know the one or other people with <unk> memory .
people , suddenly , much more detail remember , when i did n't seen it was on the situation <unk> , and tell you <unk> , i ' said yes , however , but , where you know that ?
this is , there 's very , there 's a particular , a so-called <unk> , so someone with <unk> , somebody who 's mostly in a field <unk> , the , is that 's such a good <unk> memory , who 's been in a plane , <unk> , in a plane , in a helicopter , as fast is , he then ow ' n't know , over rome , has to rome at , so rome is now ow ' n't necessarily the city , after a <unk> signs of the and has begun to rome to draw .
and it 's not somehow , so here in the river , and there is `` well , no , every single house , every single door , every single window , he even have seen , he <unk> , he could be back to paper .
how come from now this ?
so why can of this , why , we can not , now , the <unk> is perhaps pretty close that the <unk> bit more access to his <unk> percent <unk> .
now , and yes , but why can i 'm not to the edge of the <unk> night remember , in all the details ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> of me has to be interesting experiences .
he 's actually look like , in the <unk> worked and has to rape worked , who had her experience of <unk> , that was not be your mind that <unk> <unk> the brain , this is n't happen , that 's gone .
wonderful , so , the very clear .
now , it 's about that people <unk> .
there 's got them in a very safe session , at the right after this event back , even if you no more active to remember , could then you that <unk> of cars , where these people <unk> that was n't <unk> that was fifty meters on .
and indeed , with this <unk> one of <unk> caught by .
the second thing i really awesome , was , he has a lady in <unk> had that has told that your mother , and alice in <unk> <unk> , when they 're small , so four years .
there was it on my lap her mother and her mother has been reading .
and then he has her , in <unk> , <unk> a ago .
then she 's starting to read , she was four times more than that happened , and she did n't read , today can you .
and then you have said , he said , tell me to the <unk> .
they 've actually one of alice in <unk> found , right on this side of text , that the lady <unk> .
the brain , so this page as she was <unk> , as a picture .
after that could you read .
so , we 've actually have access to that , but we seem to the normal life 's say <unk> kind <unk> to have to do n't want to <unk> .
, here we 're we do n't the event , , but how <unk> have said , he has a a a picture , a , a a <unk> , we 're right in our <unk> , so this is what we see that , what we can smell , this is what we hear that , what we taste and this , what we feel , hey , if you <unk> of a yellow <unk> thinking and as it 's really <unk> <unk> , they <unk> sense , the way of like , <unk> example .
and , it was going <unk> upon tonight , put them , but <unk> comfortable down , ha , <unk> bit maintain and , can i ask you to conclude , but just a very quickly your eyes .
and remember , at a very <unk> , positive event in the recent past , yeah .
let 's the first , what happens .
and if you do this now , will tell you might notice that you to this into a visual part .
it may be a picture , maybe even a movie ?
some of that does n't on , because we that they do , but that make them for the conscious .
and if you see , it can be that they 're in the movie , from their eyes of experience , or as you see themselves on a canvas .
this one 's call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you , they allowed to the idea to solve that allowed to the eyes to open .
who 's because a visual information , one hand up ?
yes , there , but <unk> ' a few hands up , this is so , <unk> third , i would say , that 's about this , what i thought , it 's it 's actually something that we so often do that it 's the first moment n't <unk> .
well , ' <unk> on .
<unk> what 's what you 're looking at the memories , if you memories <unk> , yes not just this memory up , <unk> <unk> sense , we <unk> a positive event and i said , the one or other smile , there was so , it was beautiful , there were , you laugh , and it 's the memory may still there , actually it 's start with our memories , beautiful or other feelings .
and this is what 's exciting .
<unk> everything that was , well , which our brain makes the point is no difference between what we actually remember , and the , what we just imagine what we <unk> .
also that you can try out , if you look at home <unk> down , something in the future of the not yet happened , they 're similar information , to do something , if you look at something i remember , what the past .
and that , you know yet , these stories that you look like that tells us in <unk> round , of time .
now , hey , because this happen and this , and this was so beautiful , and the longer these stories <unk> , the people are mostly the stories , hey , there were the people have a <unk> , there was the evening , much <unk> , there was a sunset even more romantic , there was the waterfall is much higher .
if we already in <unk> , so if we really our memories and change , why do we because not active , i do ?
<unk> , when i come here , was my uncle an image showing you about his hut in switzerland .
a very beautiful picture , it 's also a very beautiful hut .
it 's the picture is the <unk> bit more than the hut , so it 's artistic freedom , he told me explain , well there 's the hut <unk> bit around , there is the <unk> bit more of grass before , there 's a gorgeous dog that , there <unk> the sun in the alps , this is quite a picture of a hut , not to make .
and why do we because not with our own thoughts , our memories , hey , that bothers me , because , when i still people do , what i was there is think ?
they 've actually an artistic and in their own thoughts .
<unk> you know , so some people that you see them up , if you just so gray eyes , which is because it ?
so i `` bad slept , i went around the <unk> through the head .
really all the night and this idea made me that go .
i think it 's vice versa , he made the idea was n't go .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he went to germany , because his mother in <unk> stayed and he did you just awful missed .
what the father made , so he 's every night with the son <unk> and has said , has been wondering , so , which was because the most beautiful , what today 's happened ?
what was because the most beautiful , tell , and then he has to tell , it <unk> , it just tell me , what today , is happening .
and , within two weeks went 's the son <unk> .
and then it was ok , that the <unk> way is that 's right back to visit .
and this is that has this all the youth who made with that is one of <unk> people that i know .
so these are not the memories , that affect the , as we are , but it 's our focus on , our focus on the idea we use .
and how much energy we need to waste , or use .
so when you <unk> <unk> thoughts <unk> or say , that was going to ow , this is so , <unk> this practice , i but really not , then make it 's a way , you know about perhaps tom <unk> in this <unk> fiction movies , he had this , that these <unk> computer , where he <unk> <unk> <unk> , you make this but also , they look for their image that <unk> have of this , well , such great a , they say , yes , well , <unk> now <unk> happening now , <unk> the way to it .
so ham , we because <unk> ' yet , ah , what really nice , look at this , <unk> , it was <unk> ' really know , man , that was that was beautiful , well ?
and then take you a with .
you take that to in your <unk> and so that i 've .
or if you see someone <unk> <unk> , <unk> , it <unk> their your head , or your wife , or her husband , <unk> , they laugh <unk> .
so , let 's so this picture , they <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let in horses jump , you laugh , why they laugh ?
because they <unk> imagine , because these kinds of fun .
and you can be much better with the situation where all of a deal .
can man memories so delete it ?
no , i think about our brain has been so much capacity , it all to store .
it makes but nothing , because we can be free vote , how much we 're going to focus and how it 's an event , a memory , an idea of them , it comes on a look .
my <unk> to you , you to play them with the photographs in your head , they use the power of <unk> and give them to every day <unk> that their lives enrich .
so good afternoon .
thank you for the invitation .
when i 'm on a party asked me , what i 'm like in my like doing and tell that i came together with friends a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , then i see shining eyes and in the head of my audience who <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> up .
and then <unk> that there 's look at the <unk> to a <unk> to classical music is , out , these <unk> <unk> pictures of old people who in just a long <unk> in <unk> would sit and very focused on the art , listen .
frank <unk> once said , about music to talk is so how about architecture to dance .
and so similar to behave , it with what we do .
so they still a glimpse get what i 'll talk , i 'm a short film with .
film
there is <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
this is it in my view the best in the point .
since <unk> 's the <unk> from the <unk> like that something completely different .
we <unk> are so forth between <unk> and the middle of the 20 years old and have very early in our youth of the tremendous force and pleasure to classical music <unk> .
we have but also have experienced that the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> us that some of you know , a little <unk> .
and we are the of belief that the so-called of the classic do n't want to the content , so on the music , but of <unk> .
so let 's look at the question , how can we have a <unk> create that the middle of the near , the friends and this force over again , the way that we so much of you may .
how can we have a <unk> put together , that the <unk> of <unk> work ?
we put the parameter that you from the classic concert know , space , time light , context , basically the question .
so , for the relationship between <unk> and musicians .
and there is between the stage and the <unk> a gap .
we 're trying to make up .
this is a picture of our <unk> .
the musician sitting in the audience , drink beer , have to the <unk> with the <unk> to stand up to play a , two pieces , look back in the audience .
this is the course of the night a little <unk> .
anyone who 's like , <unk> to come on the stage and goes back .
or that are sitting in the concert .
in the classic concert , it 's so that you have to more or less <unk> , permanent <unk> , so much like you that sits and in front look and listening .
but there 's music , because you can actually do n't sit still .
and we 've done , how do you that are .
if you ca n't sit and look at a <unk> piece of music <unk> can , listen to a way too .
yet to come to the concert not a stage , but four stages in the audience around .
the audience could be yes <unk> .
this was sitting on the night every once in the first set .
important for us is that we 're not only just any <unk> do , but that we of the music of thinking .
that we 're asking the spaces and <unk> around but also in the head of the people need the music that you like to be as you to do ?
and so , then concerts by about <unk> at 30 in <unk> that have to actually just by <unk> within , in clubs , <unk> , in ancient <unk> .
but not just the spaces around and the lighting , music is alive to make and out , but the connection with other <unk> .
and so we are totally happy that we 've been a few years with the <unk> work together , working with us dances , or movements of music to <unk> , who actually not to see this .
and so , then <unk> for <unk> of <unk> or for <unk> by steve realm .
and this year , we have a , if you want to <unk> it .
we have the first time a concert together with a <unk> implemented .
we have the story from the soldiers of <unk> <unk> with actors , <unk> , <unk> and just <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
and that most of all , which works , because we have a <unk> had to us in this piece of who has .
we talked about a <unk> much money from people out of germany <unk> , so that we <unk> .
this is this <unk> something that 's a community out of .
we are totally happy in the near the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> a home found .
the city is exactly the size that we really spaces and exciting place for concerts , but also so small that we notice .
now beginning of the spring two weeks <unk> <unk> out of europe in the city , then goes up on that the city more people with <unk> be as usually .
so the <unk> will <unk> organized .
we <unk> are a colorful mixture of students and students , medical care , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really fully completely <unk> .
and to a <unk> a <unk> <unk> , that the <unk> or coordination and funding from the eye you , <unk> to seven to 10 <unk> in a <unk> , for for a year <unk> to take over .
it 's also <unk> , but you care , for a year that , for the <unk> or the <unk> that <unk> in of hands are , and to the <unk> organized .
we do it all in our play and live in , germany .
so , the part of work out of <unk> and on a <unk> .
just three times a year , we care about the year over a <unk> weekend , <unk> , to the one or other problems that show up , and for the <unk> together , that just <unk> important is if you something like to let me .
for <unk> to come and twenty or 30 volunteers <unk> to the for a few days or a few weeks their hands bring and touch to help me , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and , in these fourteen days from the musician and .
now you could mean , so if you all you for such a <unk> needs .
but our <unk> 's even further .
we have in <unk> of a community around us the sort of us who in the what we do .
it goes from the classic <unk> go , it 's but also about very practical things like , for the <unk> , because we have a baker , of us with bread <unk> or a <unk> that allows us fresh food at it .
this <unk> is in a <unk> in the city and over the year , and sells .
to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a whole <unk> found that allow us their living at the way to the musician and samples .
and in that way and it 's the <unk> to something <unk> in that city has and the people in that city .
they identify , in a very special kind of the way with this <unk> .
since the beginning of we could you <unk> support of the citizens in place a <unk> in call that now the entire endeavor in a <unk> and <unk> <unk> turns out .
we <unk> the stage believe that classical music <unk> , provided you come in the right hands .
so we are incredibly happy about that in all the young musicians , music in your hand and you home , in the cities <unk> hold .
if you 're still not as you can imagine how , it feels like , classical music to experience , then they come but just over .
the next year we go back in <unk> and we were going to look forward , if you also there are .
yes , and gentlemen , learning .
you think maybe you know acquire .
you heard about to learn or the effect of learning , but i mean , to learn to hear more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> win .
knowing that experience , <unk> , a formula for the <unk> .
what i made of art and culture 've learned , now , because i can a lot of course , because now ar <unk> <unk> i do in this field .
and so i think that it may be right now , which is something <unk> called a different <unk> have to do is my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , but more work .
they 're going to laugh .
you get used to the laughs , though most of the saying that .
why is that ?
i think that has to do that in the word you something <unk> what we 're not that really capture .
art , that 's say , sometimes , that 's what .
to work we say that <unk> that 's what .
sometimes .
the people like to work that 's going to me .
but at work we think more likely to the <unk> and the art , at the realm beyond the <unk> , where we look inside move , our experience collecting , our own thoughts .
and so i mean <unk> that i 'm going <unk> want to about three hours in five see shared that all the headline , with a i start to do it for you very simple .
it starts with the <unk> , for the childhood , go on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth to do n't worry , then , the word <unk> , i later , why i think this for my <unk> taken .
the interaction of the first part of my <unk> life and finally , five of identification .
<unk> one of you will this is these pieces of <unk> sebastian stream know .
<unk> , two and <unk> .
you learn it in the first two , three years ago , if you <unk> practices , and i <unk> practiced .
and so with 10 , 11 years i these little bits performed , on the piano , not far from here , at the <unk> , at home .
these pieces of a <unk> .
there 's a tune played and the other voice <unk> , but it 's very different .
the rhythm is equal , but it 's <unk> .
and this , and gentlemen , is something <unk> at the art that they do , and if it just two voices , <unk> bring together , together to think if that the present , the future , the past sometimes , in <unk> , images , in <unk> , in <unk> , things that <unk> , on the right now bring together , this is doing art .
and i got to learn , two distinct melodies , sometimes , three , in the <unk> <unk> the same time to play , any kind of yet to hear that a <unk> , the other .
it was the , what i 've learned , among other things .
one another experience i 've never forget and i want to worry had that there 's me today may also to go .
i have the piano <unk> , there were more people in the room and here today , and in the <unk> i came out .
i had to forget .
i 's playing .
so again in front started and the same spot knew i decided to do n't on .
the audience have more <unk> almost as well , because i went to all alone on my place , brought my notes , put them down and started the third time of forward .
and they do n't know , how to me <unk> 've got behind .
but this was a very heavy .
maybe it was also one of experiences , where i think you know , well , with the piano , although i then , a <unk> , i may not my <unk> , because to talk , you can easier <unk> .
yes , the next the next chapter in my <unk> i said yes <unk> with the inspiration , because i want to tell stories .
and then as <unk> , i went to my <unk> and told him , rather , <unk> , i want to a <unk> play .
and he said , <unk> that 's not .
you have lots of <unk> visited , and a lot of experience with women collected .
now imagine a time ago , a <unk> young man , so , young , as a sentence .
the i certainly not forget .
and then on , i of course , more practiced .
now i was actually , and the time in a <unk> .
i practiced and i remember thinking of a situation that i 'd like never more experienced .
it was the <unk> of <unk> by chopin and now i get to the part of work , i have a place just not <unk> , and she was with the most beautiful place , very broad you had the poor , and then went on the back together and again , apart .
i can now , not going to play , is not a piano , and i could it 's not anymore .
i have this point was , 30 times in playing and suddenly , you right .
and then i think they kept playing and <unk> , i was in a <unk> performed , and i 'm just that i suddenly on the <unk> and was laughing .
i was , except me .
i did n't had , nothing , and the music has this with me that .
an experience , where i 've learned , emotions , really <unk> .
and sometimes it 's also really , for it to work that you into this <unk> <unk> , in this condition , i call it , the <unk> .
where everything from ourselves in .
we had this situation in fact , then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was then almost anything like by itself , when we <unk> made it , the only two months for , where you usually a few years to do .
now , that was my experiences with the piano , with the artistic , with the artistic work .
and now i get to my <unk> , <unk> .
i was first of a musician on , but just as <unk> .
we have <unk> performed , <unk> , <unk> .
i <unk> given and i there 's quite next to my <unk> for the music to get , and that <unk> had .
in the choir , collectively breathe , a <unk> , amazing experiences that makes me , on <unk> .
and then came up a point , where i as <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> gone , in the <unk> and the overhead , and i did that so with <unk> <unk> , this chapter , because there to me that <unk> , or so this idea , from this combination of art , culture , i was , <unk> also just in the <unk> <unk> , politics and law a profession .
because the art , culture to enable , to my <unk> .
so here are working for the art , but you do n't as artists , but , otherwise would you do n't say <unk> , but as <unk> <unk> and something to do .
i was there in theater and i <unk> , there was in germany , no <unk> for <unk> , just in vienna , there is me <unk> , and from then , i more and with this question about what you can do to art to enable , to the framework for art to make to a good management , a good administration build up ?
and this was the reason that i then also <unk> 'm in the workforce , to this <unk> , and with <unk> years , i said yes , <unk> .
but before that was a different <unk> , and this phase , i do <unk> with social interaction .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , even sometimes in my c.v , because i was in <unk> born , and says , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , about <unk> let me , i have this kind of time <unk> .
but i do a <unk> root , because my grandparents maternal were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i have the <unk> firsthand .
this was me before , something that i 'm not as the , and suddenly , i <unk> in a different form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture , who lived by people in this in this <unk> device of <unk> .
once the <unk> on us <unk> , they were all in a whole other condition , in the other states .
and i then with <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , my friend and colleague , because we then , for the <unk> tonight , music , he guitar , i piano , one of a bass performed , like , i was at that 's <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> , so , but of the text of <unk> <unk> , months practiced .
and this <unk> that was really from the people out .
it was my destiny , that i the ninth november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> n't even with that the wall fell .

i still going to that prepared to any questions for <unk> .
and down there was i <unk> for the cities in the <unk> .
and i decided to have experienced , as an example of interactions take place between two german culture .
now let 's the same language , the music is there 's wonderful and was wonderful performed , but a lot was <unk> , <unk> .
different than the <unk> it was not from the people all to myself , but it was a lot of the top , and i as a <unk> <unk> to be here to experience as the german identity , and i get afterwards , and again back to slow <unk> broken , and the german <unk> then these two countries all .
since is germany , <unk> .
since is also on the <unk> much more <unk> places .
interaction , i then but in front of things i learned and experienced , of food .
we 've done by <unk> that i had actually a <unk> , think about that time ago , when i 'm here , <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> of culture and play .
i still .
like stood for <unk> , you did n't write <unk> of culture and <unk> .
i was actually the first the edge of <unk> .
so i play not so much so , but it was amazing that i had this <unk> , but you know about to , because i then for education in charge , and make alliances with the education , and design .
we have a lot of the urban done , we have the if you just about this <unk> between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> see , what we go to have to the <unk> experience , <unk> , where you interactions between <unk> and architecture is , from <unk> for <unk> to the blue stones .
many , interactions we could and i could make and i 've experienced , and i 've what that means , if different people from different areas of the track .
you realize by that i had more and <unk> of the art , more and the culture that allow us is that look at the <unk> between people , between cultures , between communities , better , in the view , and i come but later on the art .
interaction was also then the <unk> the subject as we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea , the <unk> january <unk> that <unk> could the <unk> europe <unk> .
but this last chapter , this one chapter , but the headline identification .
this word , yes two different meanings , for one , i <unk> me with something that <unk> me so to something , and i ca but also a verb , and say , i <unk> something that means , i know something .
and it 's always in his <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , so i say , i <unk> you , or the or this community .
and i <unk> me with something , when i want to <unk> and say that belongs to me that i want to identify .
and that 's a big action .
five point three million people trying to move , <unk> cities , to identify the double senses , to <unk> and to realize that you have a community is in europe .
as big , we then <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of many people that in a big <unk> life , at a common language to talk , even if <unk> nations are and this was our <unk> of identification , <unk> in the people and of course , too much to take .
the signs , the <unk> the highway , many other <unk> .
an experience of <unk> i did not so many people <unk> .
so ham , <unk> <unk> and eat , two schools , <unk> , young girl from <unk> that <unk> , and a student from a <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , letters of people , young men , from <unk> to a <unk> of , the home , <unk> , dear , death , the last four letters written .
and it was a special effect that young girl letter from young <unk> <unk> and young russians then letter from young men in germany , something <unk> german .
and set out of young men to the piano , and played this <unk> that i was so loved .
and oh , quoted him from a letter and said , i 'm <unk> , he wrote him go home , as a german , he played , and i can never be a <unk> play , because my my two fingers exactly <unk> .
and he <unk> his finger in a <unk> , sat down to go back to the piano in this <unk> on <unk> carl and tried to the <unk> .
and it managed to do n't .
it was for me as a <unk> scene , that i 'm going forward <unk> , i said , what we actually learned ?
we 've learned in the <unk> that many people together to move , but in front of things we learned that we <unk> years in <unk> in peace , and the culture that connects us that 's no longer the minds <unk> , because we different languages talk that we 're identify , to us <unk> feel .
and this was for me a wonderful experience and you see , it 's going to do n't just about to know .
it 's going to learn to think about to learn and <unk> to win .
and so much to invent the invention tolerate that <unk> , if we tolerate that we inspire them of art and culture , our position to relate to the dialogue about the artwork , if we interact and finally , in our own identity and again , and by us with art and culture <unk> , then we all won .
and i hope you a lot <unk> and <unk> , from where they 're going to profit .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think we 're on the first picture of .
so i started to <unk> to support my memory is such a few slides <unk> .
there are but no scientific slides , but it 's in my <unk> here is , a way to find and me with a theme <unk> , where i think that 's going to the next few years significantly .
by the <unk> to do now i finally , thank you for it , what ted also means , and i think in <unk> we can this may categorize it .
and then i had just heard that you have to talk about in english is , if it possible , but if you to look , then you see , they would n't understand what i in english say to , i did not directly , as i say , and so i tried to talk , but in german left .
how we die .
i have to go there first of <unk> tell .
<unk> was my patient in the hospital , where i the <unk> <unk> , and was <unk> .
she was about <unk> years old and has always like in may <unk> , because they also working on her husband remembered that the first man who in war for was then .
and so it every year for the may , to dance went and has been <unk> and probably even then a <unk> <unk> too much had , and is then <unk> and has , here on the you see this , the broken , the <unk> .
a few years before it was also been used to <unk> and had to same way that the same <unk> , been looking at the left leg broken .
and then i was also been there as a doctor and have experienced , for weeks on the intensive care was , as you with antibiotics treated , also been re-inhabited , and have the discussion <unk> , as i said , is because that any sense ?
it makes any sense , in the old people like this intense process to use to ?
so <unk> , to <unk> , on the intensive care for weeks , is a people at all <unk> ?
and she 's then cured been .
five years later i get into the clinic to see the name <unk> , and the can i really good to realize , because he just so rare , also for the time now , and look at the dance in may be the leg broken .
it turns out the question , what <unk> i actually , if i want to speak , as a person , are supposed to know what it in his <unk> , or what he also working on <unk> <unk> ?
and that 's a little bit of the subject of <unk> .
you see here and the <unk> 's called , as we die .
it 's a book out of <unk> , as we 're going to a report on the <unk>
and then it was so that the globalization is very first went to be so you ask , how do it because , connected to work ?
you have then , and that you can in this book today , read , you know , it 's a <unk> get that the parts , <unk> .
it 's a interconnectedness of work <unk> , it 's also the work , much more you 're going to take to china , it was a big issue .
and this is then also have come to basically what the work of individuals , so to assemble themselves , something <unk> , and lower <unk> was that he always be more control was also from the quality that he <unk> of accuracy .
and that , after my <unk> that people just less and , from their work , could and more of a little <unk> , where it 's why did , as height of <unk> to reach , and no more about , through his work is also to define .
and if we now carry on the <unk> and medical area , then there , just as a suburban development .
if you on to hear , what doctors , caregivers and also <unk> the most <unk> , it the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when you have documented , what you did , so it <unk> is that it was paid , and if not being documented , says the health service of as well , that care or the medical treatment , we do n't .
and through the documentary , but the work of <unk> increasingly more <unk> and more <unk> this idea that you have his work in and to use of personal belief <unk> , in the background , as a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a good friend of me is now from holland gone , because he this is no longer , who had a <unk> practice , the given up and is from holland went to the doctor for <unk> .
the <unk> are at such developments usually a <unk> forward and it , martin , you have to be more and old people <unk> between the <unk> , the hospital , and back , because the <unk> no longer knew that you do , when it 's the people are went .
then get the to , restored to go back into the home , or <unk> , and will go to care .
and this <unk> had to me just think , if it 's a structured in holland , then i want to go to train them to be here to promote that you from this cycle of <unk> and of course , <unk> <unk> of people <unk> .
and now , in holland arrived , he was see , after he the language as much more trouble 've had learned that there is exactly the same thing happens , what the <unk> had happened .
it 's also used to die is a <unk> introduced .
it 's no longer the <unk> that counts , but you put even in a available , i 'd like , not been re-inhabited , or not to , if i am in <unk> am .
and then it will <unk> .
in holland , it 's so , on the days is a conversation with the <unk> instead , and the need to then , <unk> , i want to or i do n't have to , when i realized something happened .
so with the , i want re-inhabited , or i do n't been re-inhabited .
this data and then on a critical and there is the doctor for <unk> , has always the <unk> ago , and hits then the decision in the basis .
if we now , <unk> <unk> that 's like in may <unk> , and also used to <unk> , and we imagine that would eventually a <unk> , i do n't been re-inhabited , then if you the second dance in may , in may , where they then again <unk> , <unk> , no longer to experience .
and that <unk> my friend now , who 's in holland is , also very much <unk> , as he to deal .
in the fact , so that <unk> today about <unk> to seventy percent of people that at home to die , but in hospitals , <unk> , and that <unk> just as well , you can you see , not the ideal habitat , for an old people , but it 's often a tight financially closely <unk> <unk> there , the <unk> are often <unk> and the <unk> , and for this <unk> find out , after my sense , just limited .
there 's quite homes that very good about , there are very <unk> people that they use , but when i the <unk> at , and we 've spent about <unk> patients in the year , so about <unk> , <unk> that might look <unk> to us <unk> be , i want to say , it 's quite difficult , there <unk> and his you have <unk> .
it has of <unk> the reasons that 's very clear , this whole <unk> to control is that introduced , because the last the money to do n't enough that all people can and in <unk> of care , and that the people who care are or the medical services like that we are you to say , come and good at right , because i can take a nurse a family of food , or two children .
this is just not the fact , but it takes two <unk> in <unk> and <unk> and what does it 's just .
this introduction of <unk> as a result of all of the marketplace , and regulate want to it does 's also in the individuals affected .
and now i get to how to the maybe that , so what do we now the last , because i said yes first question , and with , so it 's the situation for affected .
and i just about this <unk> <unk> and the paper , one , there <unk> , because i think , a society , and this structure , legal structure , which we all this <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> was one is just that would of people 's <unk> .
and the second one sentence in there is , you to protect is <unk> task of <unk> .
and what i sometimes missing is a third sentence in there is , because every single also for the commission we ought to going to protect and to defend .
because this one way , to free from this case , i give it 's another way and the supposed to me a kind of <unk> and power and then do i look at least not thinking about how do , as i because even die .
because in the fact , yes , so , even if we this topic is not going to imagine , we 're at some of the point .
hopefully not too , with hundreds or <unk> .
the equivalent of my career as well , to say , i wish i each and i want to be able to worry , but eventually gets you look at the theme of the way to , and if it might as far , or even just , if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it can already late in life to be the late in life , to say , i do about this question now even think .
if you think about , what i 'd like , , you are coming , then the last out , which is because actually the five most important things in my life has been ?
there 's now a book , what kind <unk> <unk> .
it 's the self-esteem of course , there are then the friends who i have to me to and exchange , and i know , and me through the life <unk> , it 's the <unk> .
it 's quite sure that trust between people to maybe i also have to do , in <unk> or in <unk> area or a pastor or a <unk> or just another person , i work with the relationship <unk> .
and there are there 's a lot of factors of course , there <unk> , i 'm the right now , not all through .
but if you look at these three things that have to look , then you have been looking at a lot of tasks , as you look in life there might <unk> to the last his own way .
and then , then one another factor of that we have a dictatorship of <unk> experience , i did this time as a text , and as an example of that .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior that there <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
we would be just from ourselves out .
so it 's not the question , which is because other to do , who gets me because the power , for me to look for me to use , who are going to me ?
but it 's right <unk> , , where i can see on people <unk> , where i can see me to and my inner was going to me with these questions deal , and me that position and make it .
and then he says , as we 're going , so that inside of these <unk> that allow us from put , it 's a way to say , i <unk> me about my my inner , this mechanism to that .
because no human being able to me <unk> , as i himself because you can see and position .
and i have there 's not into the overall <unk> or opinions of saying , you 've now a <unk> fill and because you that old , <unk> you , right , if you re-inhabited will want to see if you , intensive care to do .
these questions that i can in the only after a long <unk> probably <unk> process .
this would of people 's inside of posture , in me , and not from that can be that the state to protect , can also a law , and i also other people <unk> , and i rather <unk> , if i just on themselves before with <unk> 've got so that 's also know , what i for a human .
and to those conversations to lead , it requires a spaces , and i think , and so i have this is called , and here in <unk> , are those spaces like this <unk> into food , i 'm here i 'm trying to come on a picture times <unk> , spaces , where we think about these issues of need to where a <unk> space is that 's not <unk> is that it may not to theoretically , but that just a conversation in place .
so , when we then old , you say , oh yeah , as a dance in may , despite my may very high age , that would have to do .
thank you welcome to your attention .
beautiful good evening .
i two things with .
if you the first part of a flat , keeping you a little <unk>
it 's a second .
we start with infinite .
it 's stupid , not , can take .
what do you ?
are different <unk> ?
or is infinite enough ?
yes !
that 's not good , if there 's about this is that we 're looking .
so , in fact , but i <unk> it , for those who know it .
so what we do n't .
we engage us with just one .
and i border to a bit of the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> we know , an infinite , let 's a to know .
and it 's for the <unk> of magnitude of tiny amounts .
if we in <unk> on , and are two <unk> , in an example , chairs , in the other people .
we know , so , now , we look at the box in the number is small , there are three chairs and there are three people .
we can we <unk> , whether in each of the same amount of there is ?
count , how would we do it ?
so , we would n't until the people <unk> , one , two , three , we get the three , we count the chairs , three chairs , one , two , three , three and three three is three , and beautiful .
this mean , yeah ?
very beautiful .
this works in <unk> wonderful , it also look at large numbers , although it <unk> .
but it does .
how do you just count ?
how do you have <unk> that so many people like chairs out there are ?
i realized chairs and people , and not what else .
<unk> let me !
it 's mate .
you very well , that this is clear , not now we 're in life on and already know that all .
ca n't know , it 's very beautiful .
so , it 's a professional a <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
you take a , of them on a chair , from the mouse .
so next <unk> the way of the next <unk> , everything is <unk> , different people get different chairs , not a chair are empty and the vast amounts of the same size , okay ?
now we go into the infinity .
how can we have two infinite amounts each other , compare ?
we would say , one is the size or more or smaller than the other .
we could we do it ?
we would go back to .
right , that 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite number of lot to count , i would be just say , they 're not to another .
<unk> , an infinite , is clear , <unk> ?
so , how we go ?
<unk> ?
no way , <unk> .
they had the but you really started .
mate .
so , now let 's the time .
appreciate that really appreciate is in the infinite , bad , yeah ?
you see , you can do n't end , yeah ?
the point is , you make it very simple .
if i like , the <unk> take a natural numbers , <unk> , we computer scientist who need to zero the beginning to zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we could have , say , a piece of this <unk> and take from this piece of the infinite number of <unk> pay off .
there are the just numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all straight numbers are <unk> on the infinite number of band of natural numbers , but on a band missing the <unk> , on the other people are the straight and the <unk> on , okay ?
we call the a lot g , straight numbers , we call the other lot to the natural numbers .
what do you ?
, g more powerful , it 's bigger than to the same size , smaller ?
in a big ?
now , very <unk> , yes , where you do n't know the <unk> .
who 's another estimate that ?
smaller ?
who says bigger ?
ah , who has , really did n't plan , yeah ?
this is yes , not be , yeah ?
you can do n't know , where what is , bigger , that 's not , <unk> ?
okay , they 're getting smaller ?
you would think , right ?
this is the <unk> , what you <unk> that 's kind of false .
and now and now , i why the vast equal .
how does it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the ground zero from the straight out , we take the ground zero from the natural lot to mate , out .
so the next to zero , plus two , two , after the zero , the one , and i 'll get back a <unk> .
the four , the two , six , the three , eight , the four , yeah ?
you can it even reverse , it doubled , this is clear , <unk> ?
and very clear , through the <unk> do we make it that i do it always in the lecture such a <unk> <unk> .
and this one , there are just the straight on and the tape is equal , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural on the straight , <unk> that <unk> 're off and the tape is still a long .
it 's just in infinite .
so when you some explain what we have learned to have <unk> learned , which is because infinite , i just finally ?
an infinite amount has a property that 's in <unk> you do n't and this trait is that is absolute <unk> , a real subset of exactly the size .
so let them in <unk> n't know , if you from three three guys are two people <unk> , it 's just another one there and before that 's three .
yes , so we <unk> .
is not <unk> ?
okay .
then we have a second part of probability .
the professionals , <unk> probability .
i so what brought .
in this experiment , i 'm sure that will make it at least one third , and <unk> it does anybody with the on it has , yeah ?
so , we call the doors a , b , c .
i 've got behind anything hidden , i hope you have it does n't heard .
and they 're going to first guess .
where , my them , i have something hidden , behind a , b , c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
you appreciate , c .
who has another idea ?
a ?
who has another idea ?
<unk> , <unk> , b has <unk> , not , you hear it 's never , <unk> ?
this is right .
it 's a matter , so you do n't mean , the three of will fall and i look for me a .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it 's very clear , because that the chance you to <unk> lucky , is yes <unk> just in a third .
<unk> , there are three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i 'm here , i just one on .
well , i know , where it .
<unk> that 's here somebody who <unk> .
so , i know , where it is , and guess and the value , like , it 's called , go into a second round .
so i 'm really the game <unk> now is now , <unk> .
so it 's so , we go into a second round .
now , so , i <unk> to focus on the a , <unk> ?
so , now i have a door , behind the n't it 's around and they do n't have said .
because , if you 're going to b , and i say , and i know , it 's not a b .
then there 's not a second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , <unk> had .
but i have , it 's <unk> , in the second round .
so i can just an open , behind the it only do n't know , but what they also do n't have said .
now the question is , and this is the <unk> probability of the condition that stayed in the condition that , b open , and it does n't really is , they 're the last chance , to guess .
they 're going to a remain , then i necessarily a on .
i 'm doing now this , what they want .
or you say , i do , c .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with this know more gone ?
<unk> , very beautiful , b is , now i know , it 's a c .
right now , god , thanks to b up being , i wanted to think about to stay in this is it .
or would you 're saying that 's <unk> , we have to <unk> the way to it , we 've just have two doors , now it 's no matter , to change or to stay .
what do you ?
it 's no matter .
<unk> .
why is it does n't matter ?
very beautiful .
why it 's why is it <unk> ?
yes , right , that 's wrong .
this is yes , almost as if we yesterday <unk> , <unk> ?
but that are you , <unk> , are a new , no fun .
so , here , the thing is quite <unk> , yeah .
and understand all sorts between , i know , six and , i ca n't <unk> years ago , you can i 'll be no more coming up , <unk> ?
so , it <unk> really want everyone .
behind the door is it becomes a third .
and it 's always just a third of a door .
you can guess what you want , they have with two <unk> get them in <unk> .
so , they would be able to two doors guess , not that you can yes , at <unk> do , you can have to two dozen sit , it , <unk> , if you the ground zero , <unk> that 's do everything in real life .
but here we just a door .
so , is now here , two of it 's not what you guess .
so is the two of here , but it ca n't just behind a door is .
behind the that 's not .
so , which is then more ?
no way , i 've really hiding .
so , which is now more ?
it 's better , to stay , or to change ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
yes , of .
so , that was now not hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
they have <unk> had .
why ?
it , two of these are not a hundred percent , the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope , it was for each of what it .
thank you .
mr. <unk> you to me , jamie <unk> <unk> , this guy just by bad food and <unk> food and <unk> people to cover , and depressed , yes completely .
but i <unk> on my best that it afterwards all the way is , these <unk> .
i come , because of <unk> farm and did until i have been at all of mcdonald 's .
this time for <unk> , right .
, yeah .
thank you for the invitation today .
i 'm here 's going to close up .
and i do n't know , whether this gentleman <unk> , so on it came to me , if i look at ted in the lake coming up to and over a particular thing to talk .
i gave me <unk> <unk> : the subject .
now , motivation is also not bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> , who said , maybe the power of one or other afterwards , sports .


of my left to the rain and do n't <unk> .
so who <unk> want to <unk> , go tomorrow early on the <unk> , i <unk> ' they all welcome .
i ' been already said , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> over the subject .
and i said , starting to do , with the subject <unk> .
do n't worry , the beauty , little <unk> , the blind faith comes up afterwards <unk> .
i said , before me just thought about it made , when i <unk> , i 'll let the where i <unk> ?

trust , in sports , of the <unk> but at me , <unk> and beer .
why tell ' i the story , where i come from ?
for me is one of the very important stories that i really , right away from the country , from the village come ' and raised me with two big brothers , with the oldest brother , the <unk> .
and with the second brother , the same blind , like me .
means that looks like bright and dark , who can see how i just as well , where <unk> window in the room , whether it light on , or out .
what 's very practical , for the <unk> .
now , or we both can you see , once in front of us anything .
<unk> <unk> , but i say , and i ca n't tell that 's <unk> man <unk> <unk> .
of the theme of the old men , <unk> .
and to go <unk> .
and what to me , but still very crucial that 's kind of course , the fact , written you trust and get you do this great confidence that <unk> that we all need to <unk> as something <unk> situation , tell me .
and that was for my parents definitely that you how many of them , before my brother and i do n't blind know .
we were so the first , then sort of in their lives <unk> .
and then they had to them out of the situation of what do .
and , now <unk> i , it 's a giant lucky that my parents to farmers are not all the day long time had to us to stand and look at the hand to or to say , there 's <unk> wall , there <unk> you , along and can then <unk> feel , where you <unk> .
and that would be awkward been -- we do so <unk> .
and b ham our parents of the beginning of us to encouraged , always been able to go to where also our sighted brother .
so , at home alone <unk> that <unk> <unk> and <unk> , it 's risk .

the <unk> the <unk> i until today still .
this is that to the big brothers , who are not only good for the elbow but also for the <unk> .

and that the <unk> brother and excitement starting with three years and then we wanted to course , -- michael and i .
and we then started , with <unk> to the way to be a little kids , today with the wheel is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> this .
but we have this starting with <unk> , eventually it .
and then is the big question : how <unk> ma , there ?
and how do you trust , on the trust the parents , that the children , eventually , the bicycle <unk> and <unk> and on the trust of us that we do n't let 's where it go .
and our solution was that we of a lot of our parents tell us have , where are the <unk> , so where is a car , where <unk> his followers , where they may also have any <unk> things , right homes -- who do you 're not only way -- because we knew that they are .
and we had to us in orient to us that one realize that the other thing as well .
and that you can now here in 'm not all the test , because otherwise , it here 's out that she 's nothing more of .
but <unk> the night when it 's light up and look at their bedrooms , and whose bedroom , then they orient .
can you 're trying to just <unk> <unk> with the tongue , to orient and they will find that 's with us humans as well , bats are also -- they 're a resistance .
so how the bats are so with <unk> will also you hear , now <unk> wall , <unk> resistance because the sound of different <unk> .
and this is to me in the trust , faith in the movement , always very important .
but <unk> as high <unk> to have and the security , i ' <unk> chance to me because <unk> piece to help .
and i just to deal with no big trouble and , it also have many accidents , the one or other there 's certainly been .
what i 'm going to do n't take more i ' that i 'm very <unk> myself , from one of our <unk> as well as kids .

i ' and this : the confidence 's also by a <unk> diversity .
and that my ' i 've been quite literally , because i was a man , that much too much later in <unk> and in the <unk> with confidence in the scientific , has got , i 'm talking about one thing that yes , i never been so <unk> as i 've piece of .
i ' of never been so you may also dramatically read .
, but it also to do that there 's certainly not everybody 's exactly <unk> experience .
all is in the <unk> our strengths with the <unk> to look at some to know where i 'm very well , what i talent and where i can just mean , really too full <unk> ?
and our brother of again , who has michael and i always <unk> on the roofs of the house .
so then , okay , we ham and a <unk> .

and the <unk> was then <unk> , michael behind and i said , probably already still <unk> bit like the girl playing , <unk> <unk> , i know .
but over the end , who are like to go down ?
so i do n't .
and i <unk> on the <unk> , we are , the generation of young women , it 's not .
and so i hold and yet , with .

because trust is all of the way , when others <unk> .

is , but never happened .
he had , and so <unk> that he 's just as well , slowly <unk> , or <unk> <unk> has that allows us and back .
and that , `` i want to me a great , that we have had .
but to do n't worry that 's not a requirement , not necessary to later <unk> .
for me were the different <unk> that in my life and more important , all , interesting .
and , they were all of <unk> , because i just as could see , where i ' i mean borders , which is you might be so my <unk> .
so to <unk> good <unk> i would never be .
so i had never the <unk> .
and i go , until today is not like in <unk> .
i go , until today would come out of rain .
now , not at five degrees , and right .
and at <unk> rain , but rather than the inside .
but i ' time for me so this faith in my strengths and discovered that i different <unk> , i .
the first example , <unk> .
and this was for me very beautiful , because there 's the instructor that allows us in <unk> , i did : ok , we have a noisy <unk> children and send ' us <unk> couple of the blind children .
actually is yes , because you pack you anyway each of coats .
and then notice that you know , what the other .
and there was always been so my big trust , of course , if i was the competition for a place 'm going to make it difficult , because you can the other maybe a what do , what i do n't <unk> .
so it 's just a way , and that 's the confidence in my <unk> .
the other put a foot in the <unk> imagine , i find yourself backwards fall , the <unk> head out and then is it back and the competition is over , because it the full score is .
i 'll make it 's not try out .
i had i think but <unk> .
i <unk> , this is now <unk> bit risky .
and i would have so now have volunteers , right ?
<unk> .
crap , i <unk> ' already .
okay .
so next to me point was a sports in school but then the <unk> and just <unk> .
my parents were home or are until today <unk> and that they 're also told as kids .
but i was always in school , right thing : how can i 'll just as much , after the school are going to my excess energy get ?
and i had then as a way in school <unk> .
and although i 'm always thought , that 's all , ' <unk> boring , because <unk> is sort of the <unk> rather , <unk> ' i .
i found ' i used to -- <unk> ' i 'm not anymore .
i then eventually , well , i do with the <unk> .
and i , then you first 've got a man , again , this is the great diversity here in the sport , because you <unk> , you need to , <unk> good coordination and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- you 've probably much of course , from their work recognized ?
so that 's also in <unk> .
you will only then quickly , if you just the full faith in the your technology .
if you trust in the own <unk> has -- so the force that you know , but also then in every conditions , bad weather , soft snow , <unk> snow , on the <unk> bring it .
and if you 're in my case you have faith in the team .
because when <unk> that do n't see , i 'm so on <unk> <unk> .
and it 's have n't like <unk> 's like today -- i have to the use -- my <unk> -- there 's it 's just one -- has now been looking at my practice .
power , but nothing , we make them yet again .
or i <unk> 's going to be easy .
do with a , one , one of you later is another exercise .
what i actually used to do the subject <unk> trust , this is the exercise that i had the listener to me just imagine 'm like this is if you do n't see a <unk> to make and fifty <unk> <unk> .
so <unk> <unk> yes , you have two sticks in my hand .
and therefore , right , i ' i do n't have a hand , free , you could i said yes , ' <unk> take and on the <unk> <unk> .
's not .
so i have to me different .
i then my <unk> that 's going to walk .
and he told me with the voice , the way .
so the needs of the exact <unk> .
and that 's important to trust .
the precision of communication , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tells me just always <unk> , if it <unk> is that tells me <unk> and <unk> , who says , left at 11 , then i know it 's easy to the left , so on top of the <unk> at the pointer .
when he says , left on top 10 bit <unk> to the left , and when he says , right on top 10 .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem , because then i have again <unk> or he has to me , correct , then i know , , here 's what do n't .
and for me is the very big , critical , if the <unk> going to walk , then i have to me to really fully <unk> to make it 's negative to say .
so he 's good to say , he 's for me that tool that i was allowed to a really then quickly , and in <unk> even faster than others , in the competition start .
and that i can only , if i 've just create , with both arms to <unk> to me <unk> , on a leg to stand and i have now really the eyes to make -- ha ha , or it can also open , it 's nothing .
and to think you just like <unk> and to then on the leg and just going to stand and may be here <unk> bit <unk> , but to actually more quiet .
also with high shoes .
yes , and this is for me that critical , i look at the <unk> 'm just : how <unk> i actually , the guy , so i tell guy , because i actually just men and <unk> , create and it 's just to say , hey , you 've got to me the right <unk> , because the right , who looks for themselves .
who knows that 's not what he tell me .
so i 'm one of him the way to communicate just open .
and that 's like in every <unk> .
if someone my needs n't know , he told me , of n't help , but there i just wondered , and must say , well , i do ' of you through the curve , maybe <unk> <unk> used to <unk> .
or i do ' of you like now , <unk> that their me just as well , says , as long , the mountain in fact , because if we the <unk> <unk> , because you think , at some time : now have it 's over .
and <unk> again in how <unk> and the thing you just not on .

and therefore , for me a matter , because the exact same time , <unk> <unk> .
i listen ' <unk> -- here 's probably one that are also <unk> <unk> go ?
who 's more ?
so my best to have been times faster but that was in september and now , in april , may , i 've honest , have never been so much more able to <unk> .
and the <unk> and right now <unk> .
and for me , as i said , this exact <unk> only then possible , if i just mean to open got .
the other , but also just explain what he to see and i 'm like the possibility is , taking a perfect <unk> .
and this is to me one of the very important things : why i say , trust is more training and not this <unk> <unk> .
so , ' of the blind , not so much , -- from <unk> .
because i also been the experience had to me a <unk> right , and the wrong <unk> .
and then it was in the competition and bad , because it in the way three feet <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet of <unk> .
and therefore , as i said , it was -- of <unk> <unk> .
so i know , because the <unk> have to do around , have so <unk> <unk> .
and i 'm going on it 's what else 's that i would say , left and say , <unk> , the left .
so it was then all right , unfortunately .
power in life often not so much .
but , it in <unk> situation with pressure , that you probably also all of work or the university of like , if it 's going to go .
it 's kind of course , precision , yes <unk> <unk> tough challenges .
but for me , as i said , which means <unk> trust you know , i built the risks know .
and i have honest , is me as someone who do n't see , sort of the advantage , because i <unk> on the risks in many ways .
so the <unk> <unk> ' i now this kind of all .
the driving <unk> tree , from the fall <unk> down <unk> , you know i and i <unk> ' but of course , and this is the point -- i <unk> on the good news sites .
the and then also be done , if that trust me just there is .
and if you had found , of a really a hundred percent of <unk> , as i 've just need .
and with me , as these goals , i .
because this is for me in the trust me just the next , critical .
it takes the goal and i have a really also clear , what does it really , trust , to take ?
because of is often <unk> more quickly realized that you use .
i trust , or the right to myself .
but that 's critical is that 's too much on .
that you for that you to trust a <unk> .
and that you know that -- because we are all with <unk> <unk> <unk> fulfill -- we want <unk> sense that .
and the sense that 's quite often that we just going to create , <unk> goal together .
that we do it -- in my case for example -- a few , weeks i ' i am i on the <unk> .
and there <unk> ' i just like , i have to me now they 're looking , or the i in the case that trust is that i just this mountain , up <unk> .
and how do you , and then that you on the mountain , at some really up there is ?
well , i had of the giant advantage , i said , some things are not <unk> , if it for example beside me a hundred meters <unk> .
then i was this sort <unk> .
can <unk> advantage to be , <unk> which is no problem .
and i ' , again , <unk> worked , regardless of the <unk> i 'm going down and the time to have ' i then sort of <unk> <unk> or 'm in berlin <unk> , there 's going to do with <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
it 's been <unk> bit <unk> , if you up there 's and down the cars hear , then you do n't even more see , to go to know now , it hurt , if i <unk> .
and these things are for me and more interesting .
now , to be the <unk> to have but to just as opposed to know : hey , i war on the , i and so we focus , <unk> and can just by but also <unk> a new experience .
and that <unk> <unk> bit of the <unk> , because at <unk> mountain <unk> yes , you go every 10 hours to go and it 's one easy to <unk>
you go and goes and has just rocks to look around , less and plants .

so if you <unk> <unk> see , it 's the <unk> about the last , the <unk> .

we have the <unk> just from the distance , or the other you .
and therefore <unk> ' i <unk> a faith in the <unk> -- despite his strange <unk> that he is .
because i thought i ' : well , so , as i say there <unk> ' i probably going away , like to the the thing <unk> .
but as i said , it 's otherwise pretty <unk> , because you wait for <unk> actually now not that 's a change .
and really exciting is , then , if you know something hard .
so if you then in the height <unk> and the air thinner .
or if it in a <unk> , if you then <unk> little <unk> , where the left and right <unk> .
then it 's very nice and if it then , night , and all of <unk> <unk> , then , in the <unk> been looking at times as well , now he 's why i prefer to the wire , so he then i also really in looking at the grip .
because i was only thing without <unk> there <unk> and this was him , but sometimes to be risky .
trust , we have this is that i just as i was : well , i can of my <unk> , my friend , it was a hundred percent of trust , i <unk> ' , and we have that 's been doing <unk> .
but i do , also <unk> form of security , so i do n't 's focus to , because , you can imagine , if you on the mountain always say <unk> stone , right , right on one , left at 11 .
there will you look at some <unk> , and it 's all .
so , for us faith in the case been , we 're looking <unk> connection , so ham and a rope on your backpack of that i had in my hand and i then behind her to <unk> <unk> rope did .
had in the other <unk> <unk> that i also with <unk> bit of the height of <unk> 've got .
and she 's then eventually just stuck with the foot <unk> stone <unk> or , with their <unk> <unk> stone <unk> that i just have already knew what , so on me <unk> and i do n't 's just focus .
and what i made it just really have shown , how beautiful it is if you of course , then eventually , because the top of approaching that you just this will be really so again , around it -- just like to the <unk> , with the <unk> .
the fact , but also that i 've got on that trust that i had to me was ' that is the <unk> just because , if i 'm really <unk> goal was the way of the top .
but that trust is also in other , the <unk> how to trust me just work .
and then at night of the mountain <unk> , we were in the group of the way forward and behind us are the other seven people walked and they were always fairly close behind us and it has to each break was somebody else behind us and i 've been thinking : tell ' time , why do that because what 's because , everybody that he 's behind us to walk ?
at night , you can also the girls not from the back at .
this is somehow not the reason to be .
and then i ' i mean 've , ah , ok , to their faith in their skills 's been also look at some pretty <unk> .
you go there at the dark , it 's about 12 watch out , then the first no light .
this is totally <unk> , if you <unk> , the air , skinny , so basically just <unk> and now that <unk> first .
and then , but eventually , the moment where the , have said : man , that was actually , essentially , behind you to go , because the friend of me was just all explained , we 've always <unk> -- how the women , this .
have all the night us anything , and the others in the group , right there just as the confirmation , <unk> to know , ok , it 's just <unk> hour , that 's got me then .
or i gave her what 's very different from now not the mountain .
and that to know it 's someone else , it may also doing it 's <unk> about how we might be talking about -- there are just <unk> hour , the sun 's coming up .
and these things that the mirror from outside can trust , significantly increase and can just to contribute to be so the personal gold medal but also done .
and for me is trust , then given , and is , then perfect , if you know that the personal gold and this , what you really reach me , then eventually , in the notion that 's there .
it 's kind of course , it in the exercise with the gold , in that you <unk> -- i 'm also not , why this <unk> do -- maybe , i 'm not to the value to test , or to look , whether it but only can lead <unk> is ?
so i <unk> ' at some medals it 's so , in vancouver who were six grams a hard .
if it all real gold , then <unk> i 'm not here , then i would be on the <unk> , <unk> i .
or at least in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but as i said , i <unk> on the real , why you that makes it 's more that you can imagine : what i ' i actually been created and how i mean skills and forces focused on a point .
how i ' i was going to me in my skills , but of the team that we all need to matter whether the by studying , in the job in which one thing .
no matter whether the old man or a young woman , we need of people , and we trust .
and if we then the goal in the head of the eyes , and also done , then that is the proof that we 're at least in a project in our lives of trust .
and if you make it again , you can make it 's definitely in other areas .
thank you
a science to me , that 's the title of my <unk> , who did is to <unk> their of cards .
what i was driving , is the the very <unk> effort , the sciences , as something <unk> in general population of <unk> .
basically , i could satisfied .
when i 'm in a <unk> <unk> that 's all <unk> only with the literature to scientific themes that <unk> <unk> .
and everybody <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> the scientific issues , <unk> issues , somehow understand this .
everybody <unk> has at a <unk> , sort of scientific themes of .
even know , it 's totally <unk> , if you watch what it in magazines and <unk> for children 's a scientific issues .
every program , sort of a own <unk> in <unk> , but is that a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing that they can i love to look at that can i love to read , but that this is to do n't even .
cool , cool is science just sort of on csi , for breaking bad , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , <unk> ?
on csi as a <unk> five minutes , has had nothing with the reality to do , but this is cool , <unk> ?
there , because i can to identify .
big bang <unk> , because i can about laughter , i understand the jokes , but it 's great .
this is extremely too .
because , that 's kind of a paradox of the future will only we manage to do with these technological <unk> and issues .
but at bay that none of yourself .
i have a little piece of time <unk> , like science , or science has just in such a <unk> .
a very <unk> example , in london , you a tower being built , <unk> , the architect , let 's not just , we build this time in such as <unk> .
what happened , right now , that are from up into this <unk> , i think of the time <unk> <unk> is focused , somewhere in other <unk> at some point <unk> .
it went up through the press , there was , just a jaguar .
too , the heat , so <unk> that this poor <unk> , the really long , long saved , there are the <unk> <unk> .
and ask you , as an architect , the n't actually sort of times as a little thing in physics learned , because i mean , is completely new that 's a mirror things focused .
so , what i found , completely new , is <unk> , somehow <unk> ago <unk> , where he supposedly , rays a fleet <unk> .
this question i really , which has the more design , or an architect , where he has studied ?
now this is a very <unk> example .
a classic , which <unk> of current issues , is also the <unk> .
<unk> , this is now been a few years ago , when it 's just sort of the media .
there was the train , <unk> , because <unk> changed the plants , that was on a danger .
genes that was <unk> with green <unk> .
genes that were kind of what <unk> .
<unk> , oh , there are gene inside .
there were moments , where the market farmers are actually become , `` hey , i 've <unk> vegetables .
no idea what it 's , yeah .
so , yes , okay , <unk> tomatoes , we can about it discussing .
but the time i was in the lab , and for and was eventually , frustrated , because i 've tried to this evil , in my bacterial <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came home , and my <unk> neighbor , <unk> , you see but not happy , which is because it ?
i like this : yeah , i 'm here for three days as a little gene in the bacteria to transform and that does not .
it was the , what i 've tried to to explain what kind of a <unk> , gene , i thought , is the good lady , when i 'm talking about genes 'm going to do you , what she says .
it was the , what i actually said , so a particular sequence that i go into this <unk> <unk> bring .
but it was the what the woman perceived .
this woman was never again the hand <unk> .
who knows what i want you <unk> , <unk> ?
genes that 's what 's <unk> .
now this is pretty good about 10 years ago , and yet it sort of consciousness <unk> .
genes , this is any of what <unk> .
<unk> i really long did n't want to read .
it 's then the gene technology , free and it , but really in our language <unk> be .
<unk> 're going to europe was a headline .
<unk> 's a lot of other corn , yes , no , contains .
another headline , <unk> , rats to die .
yes , that was also a headline .
so , but not so , and it 's also quite anyway , on the level i 'd be ways .
anyway , whether the time or the picture , all talk about <unk> .
fortunately , it 's not yet <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm afraid , this is also not a long .
but it turns out that uncertainty in the population has , because you just not to the issues <unk> .
nevertheless , we in our future of us with these technologies .
now was just <unk> , nobody had the big on the subject , but there are about things to the elected , which most of really no idea .
and it 's pretty sad .
how come in all this information from the lab in the population ?
if we assume that this little bit of young , motivated , sitting in his lab , has an experiment , <unk> anything , beautiful and well , and he <unk> think , man , that 's a thing that interested but the public .
then have the first of the professor .
the head , who decides then , okay , cool topic , of his name on it as <unk> , this is increasingly important in science , <unk> .
good idea , i 'm still not in the public , it 's a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> think , oh , great idea , class , because we make a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , because we have a <unk> with a project , a nice idea , and it comes and somehow get out of the <unk> .
this will then <unk> , but at about who really ?
well , such institute rarely go by , usually have multiple <unk> such a common <unk> , a common <unk> .
and from all these are then the <unk> that really cool projects , then over the <unk> to the magazine , to the <unk> , whether it 's leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
this is the way .
from the basis of it will always on filtered , in the <unk> up until the really , really cool experiments , that really <unk> projects , there in these <unk> up .
these are <unk> <unk> magazine , who are really well done that 's of all are free , but who <unk> i do ?
basically , just the , for it .
in the <unk> we call this is the <unk> the <unk> .
so , anyway , to be interested in the <unk> then , the newspaper , yeah , and well .
beautiful magazine , reached the audience that , to be interested , which may be about an idea , where <unk> 's even in these <unk> .
who <unk> ' i would make but really ?
the <unk> that it anyway interested .
the no way , that was now , the otto <unk> , i call him a gentleman <unk> <unk> , under a different <unk> read , i 've tried to the neutral of the <unk> i do n't really .
nevertheless , again , our future we 'll just sort of <unk> , if we with these <unk> .
fracking . <unk> , renewables , <unk> , these are all of the <unk> are capable of mr. <unk> but not really understand , and that he sort of <unk> .
my project , my idea is , unlike <unk> , these little bit of young , motivated , out of the <unk> to take , really fully by his regular <unk> to separate , and it 's a course to give , a seminar how to science understandable communicates .
what is what happens that a scientist so i have a buddy , we know it 's been good about 20 years , he 's <unk> , it 's in a <unk> rule , it does n't want to his job to ask .
when he won the mouth <unk> and over his career telling , he 's <unk> .
<unk> , that 's a scientist who tell you one thing about <unk> .
<unk> , listen to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> 's almost like that same level of genes .
<unk> treated like , somehow , oh , you do n't know , what it 's .
the really teach listening to pass time on that 's nice and well , if you on a conference is and your people , your <unk> , <unk> anything to tell you want to think you can you to talk about <unk> tell , but <unk> and again , say , but just water on .
where is the problem , it really <unk> and a normal to talk ?
i school , well , that 's my idea of these young scientist who have n't so far in the hierarchy <unk> is that 's a little <unk> , the school and how to understand a .
this did for all to use , <unk> , but anyway , investors who want to know , what 's in the <unk> happens .
so it 's also taxpayer that there are used to be so that have to actually , <unk> communicate .
but the these training , that 's just a story .
i want you also really going on a jury sit and the supposed to your project to your project a jury , <unk> , <unk> , frankly , even worse 's not , kids .
there 's a quote , i do n't know that that really is , of albert einstein , if you 's not just tell you , then you have n't it really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab to take and your project to rethink , how can i really a normal understandable to communicate ?
so stories are already <unk> .
<unk> are totally modern , is everywhere , in on every college , very common , but also there <unk> i basically , just over the <unk> .
who 's because for <unk> the city in the university at some sunday morning , to go to talk to <unk> <unk> off ?
this is that it anyway interested .
because i decided to my <unk> .
so , that are the people , anyway to think that are going to drive , and individual 's listen .
this is beautiful , there are any <unk> , all are being , they 're happy to drive home , and that 's it .
and sit i still working on a second thing to say , it is not in this <unk> of the project .
those scientists are , trained , like <unk> actually children ?
because a really <unk> have to look at the to reduce .
because scientists , like the research , and how to their world explore , is identical .
children are working at extremely scientifically .
they do something like to the running .
they try and that does this ?
<unk> , falling down , no way , does n't know , next iteration , i change a couple of parameters , do it 's a new .
children are extremely scientifically .
these are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> , what happens , which factors i do have that it works .
this is normal .
but that have a lot <unk> .
and so i think , really work , the only if , after the <unk> , and those scientists permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the kids out of kindergarten , from the primary school , there in experiments are the kids , on their <unk> , and there really want to that with , because i 'm convinced me that the children and the scientists in fact , the language .
and then you can perhaps , and eventually , this is so my hope to tell the children and then also look at home , and then <unk> i also , mr. <unk> , and then also on one time for scientific issues interested , because the children with this talk .
this is then not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not anywhere , galileo , but his kids will tell him something that it <unk> mirror , <unk> worked out that , but a bread <unk> that there paper <unk> , well then , and shake it may also the head , as an architect 's a house can build .
and not just <unk> i then , mr. <unk> , but the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it just another thing that the first <unk> that i called , have said , no way , so , <unk> for our scientists , and this is just not subject that i 've just other priorities .
a scientist to do n't want to communicate .
yes , i think i then , okay , then there i the next .
but who somehow in a institute works , <unk> is in a company , but anyway , there are in the break .
thank you .
i went crazy , is the question .
now , you can also not every day .
the last few weeks , awful .
the weather , a big <unk> through the bill .
in seven , soon after eight years , i wondered , if i 'm here 's take me .
i was before ceo , almost 10 years , the <unk> <unk> in <unk> and in <unk> .
we 're there 's right away from the top .
had <unk> as a client .
and for me that was actually more you know , it 's <unk> .
what do this really ?
<unk> , that 's actually ridiculous .
i then we 've learned how there 's and so i stand here today .
and so maybe it 's a little crazy , but it is , too high emotionally .
it 's nice and exciting and make great fun .
and i 'll tell you just in the next <unk> , <unk> minutes of a bit of life of <unk> tell .
i 'm ceo of the <unk> .
the company , there 's been a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm ceo of <unk> .
this company , there for 20 years .
and ceo of <unk> .
the company , there 's been about <unk> or <unk> years .
who runs the zeppelin here at <unk> .
zeppelin .
it a picture that i 'll show here to the little thing right , that 's actually as a red , as a <unk> on , or anything to do n't know , exactly this point is still too big .
there is the world 's just <unk> <unk> .
and it 's actually just by now , 10 action .
this is already know what .
there 's about 20 thousand active world <unk> .
so that 's actually no market .
this is also do n't even a <unk> .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why do you think you 're really ?
how do this mean ?
<unk> in which and only 10 active , because we can afterwards to talk about why this is .
very quickly to the story .
<unk> has one of crazy <unk> <unk> of aviation and started .
very short <unk> .
has to <unk> fourteen before the first world around <unk> <unk> in called .
then they were in the world war , <unk> zeppelin died by <unk> and <unk> , have been around <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
they have the london bombarded by , so forth .
and when we <unk> and eight to london 's coming , and with a large <unk> there 's a <unk> campaign to fly , were the english newspapers <unk> full of the headline : this time you come , but not to bombs , but in <unk> intent .
so that has the story because in <unk> .
and we had a 'm wrong campaign .
but <unk> , the customer , was not so very pleased , because it suddenly realized i 've become is what 's still there was that old memory in there 'd .
and you know that was : wait for the <unk> a critical .
but it was in london a campaign for the weather in the north up there was many years ago , very bad and very <unk> .
and we 're not very much flew .
then , <unk> 20 , <unk> <unk> hugo <unk> has now taken .
and has a <unk> <unk> , and then to america delivered .
it has a myth <unk> that all the german nation of the back into something felt , when you <unk> and <unk> the <unk> kidnapped .
there was the then in in new york receive with <unk> .
and all the german nation 's up , <unk> , we 're going to you .
this is in all <unk> so inside and this is really that tells a bit of myth of this device .
but really are then to <unk> and <unk> only five , six , seven <unk> even more were built and actually just two really big , the <unk> zeppelin and the <unk> , the passengers carries .
passengers a hundred , where all around <unk> passengers and <unk> , at the <unk> <unk> .
it was but a myth .
and the <unk> then there was the first live <unk> crash , there , unfortunately , <unk> .
in the titanic that event that , where is an icon , a a product <unk> is and then , no longer a flight .
the other machines were <unk> .
and <unk> , <unk> the last one is <unk> destroyed .
that the materials are used for <unk> , <unk> that <unk> mined .
then was for nothing about <unk> years .
and then they had the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the zeppelin that had the idea , maybe you should it back to start .
and i was <unk> <unk> , because you that is actually a great product has evolved , we get right now , but the market .
yes , he had a market ?
what is there 's actually go ?
so .
talk about we now .
the <unk> zeppelin , this is perhaps even just want to <unk> , we ham , <unk> 's still , <unk> , people who has a lot to .
there are many companies that from this <unk> born .
there are today <unk> employees , about 20 billion revenue .
this is a real <unk> , the profitable .
there 's a lot behind .
they 've got me then also believe , here .
the zeppelin , is actually a completely normal plane as any other plane as well , but , sorry , has <unk> a gas , helium n't use hydrogen , and <unk> also a <unk> with <unk> .
's like a whale , in the water on and under <unk> , and the <unk> do .
the time is now n't there , that in detail .
inside does a zeppelin like , with a structure .
there are two kinds of <unk> .
there 's <unk> <unk> , this is us , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
they 're inside a structure and they are sort of the balloon in <unk> .
these are the most <unk> that in the built have been , around <unk> , <unk> piece .
and it 's only today , as i showed said , just <unk> in which minus our own insisted that 's just 20 .
this is then the production , if a shell raised .
on the structure .
and the shell is also <unk> .
comes from the <unk> .
the origin , the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the origins .
it one point two million dollars a shell .
and is to <unk> be able to <unk> , and has also <unk> be , because again and you do you look that if a <unk> inside , or a hole that there 's not going <unk> .
there are the <unk> again <unk> , and look closely , whether it 's going on holes are controlled .
and by the does a <unk> without the <unk> like it 's there .
the zeppelin 's technically a <unk> product
and that you see here down to the numbers , very short time .
one point nine percent , one point nine percent , one point of four percent <unk> , which means of a thousand flights in about falling maybe <unk> .
this is very very little and very good .
this is a <unk> .
they can see .
but there 's a different trend that allows us right about power and the 've got up here <unk> .
we had three years ago <unk> percent <unk> , when i started to have a half ago <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may we were at <unk> percent .
if you the eight years , eight years , the zeppelin <unk> and <unk> it to do , then you can say at least in these eight years ago , of a <unk> the <unk> , also clear , in these eight years ago , the weather really changed to us .
we 're <unk> .
we can go there passengers also not by fog .
they want to do something .
and the <unk> or <unk> go up in every year at .
so a little <unk> of that our weather , not just felt , but also statistically , because we do the weather every day , it changes .
but because this is that 's now the good , has the e.u . a program <unk> <unk> , almost 10 million dollars and we 're a <unk> part of this program .
i come this morning , from finland .
this <unk> is <unk> , is a flying lab .
<unk> is the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between the ground and <unk> feet .
that means <unk> <unk> .
and the zeppelin t going to italy , up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
over many many hundreds <unk> measures , and analyzed the air out how to <unk> , as you responded to our stuff that the ground .
there , so i was explaining to come up there are we just with the second <unk> .
a great a great commission .
and is if you want <unk> <unk> from the theme of weather .
it 's so very good .
and here are 's a few <unk> .
this <unk> of sweden last week or <unk> week .
and in finland is by the weather super , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the <unk> say that have you have never .
i i 've been there 's wonderful , beautiful warm days firsthand .
these mosquitos , then also not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have to de <unk> as <unk> diamond looking , better way volcanoes looking for that <unk> is that go away , through <unk> through a million years .
only can you also ask , is that 's all of africa , is then a <unk> if you to make sense , after one idea , after a question is it makes sense if at the theater at the movie <unk> or <unk> diamond did .
because i 've ever wondered , you know what we do you 're really ?
and what do we go there really ?
so at we were looking for two years and also done .
the <unk> was then also not on .
the entire <unk> came back <unk> and the project was then they finished .
and a tornado , the zeppelin the mast , and so broken , that he also going down to stay .
, but not so bad .
we had a very good insurance , and they were actually quite happy .
so this is the prototype .
and i did n't know what i want to do .
yes , what we do , a very quick <unk> of the <unk> .
what we do , it 's about to me just about , it 's about complexity , it 's about questions , growth , which .
what we do is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do <unk> course .
so we have the zeppelin always get .
<unk> is <unk> .
there are , and also devices in , after 10 , fifteen , again , the replaced to be .
we 're just the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients <unk> talk about 's go .
we do we have the <unk> constantly .
we 're a aviation <unk> <unk> , from the germans <unk> and from the european <unk> controls , and again , and all , with <unk> how <unk> , or as <unk> .
this is also <unk> and costs money and must always going to get .
the question is , do you actually going ?
you want to evolve ?
you make more <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
what makes you 're really ?
do you keep in the market ?
we 're going to <unk> ?
and that we have all of course , in my time to try .
and we also some <unk> <unk> .
so by the <unk> zeppelin some <unk> <unk> , and <unk> bust .
the beginning to <unk> stood still a donation of <unk> .
the population of the german population has it was rescued by six million <unk> as a donation , when the fourth <unk> <unk> , and he basically what bust , has the population of him a donation .
and it 's all the <unk> <unk> zeppelin and the other companies are born , because we 're sitting right <unk> what i anyway not here and other companies are n't there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco to a client .
there was a very <unk> <unk> .
both of projects , unfortunately failed .
so , <unk> .
simultaneously , we <unk> won .
because i did n't a picture , because we <unk> <unk> have n't show .
but just in america 's now the <unk> of the first <unk> in the finished .
we have three and sells .
with <unk> of where we like a deal with a partner , the technology , new .
and this is a great success , but at the that you .
two customers are basically what <unk> , because it was .
why did n't it ?
we know it already .
either was the location of the right or the passengers had to go <unk> or in america 's did you <unk> the last 30 <unk> years , the advertising .
the ham people have <unk> , the <unk> that have said , <unk> , again , again a <unk> , the power in advertising .
there , who did n't realize that you <unk> .
and it was actually the hard in marketing and over to : hey , people call , and fly .
<unk> 's good .
the pilot transport a year , transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year we just <unk> done because of weather .
there are then in a half a million .
this is so bad .
the zeppelin going <unk> routes .
it 's the sense of course , is if i also the ceo then see how the passengers <unk> and , and all of laughter and we basically what 's not advertising , because it out to speak goes over and we have about <unk> sold <unk> , and people say , this is so beautiful , and i recommend it your friends , which and who , on the family .
and we are great <unk> .
what i again and <unk> have to the mistake that you think we 're <unk> .
you could still more flights .
we have such a <unk> the <unk> and we are <unk> .
it 's actually also not quite .
we 're also advertising .
this is a <unk> been that audi <unk> .
and audi has this here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a harder .
and you have to be the <unk> imagine : do advertising and more sense ?
we have actually have enough ads , but the internet has a change that <unk> about the launch , because the <unk> everything .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , so there 's just another 10 active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one <unk> that <unk> , three , <unk> bought , 10 're actively .
so , then six of 10 .
so , we will then the market in fact , if it at one is to control .
and hope , it also be a future to .
and what the end david scott , commandant the apollo fifteen years , after his <unk> paris <unk> and five , he has said , <unk> the walk on the <unk> what <unk> .
so <unk> is beautiful .
advertising do , we also you .
just do we do n't have a client .
<unk> to do we find great , has a technological .
there 's customers .
that 's not at .
it 's <unk> , go up , and off .
so one such a <unk> need for up to do .
and then we then again , no .
there 's also weird effect that easy for and hard to control .
anyway , it 's the situation , <unk> , a point in <unk> , so actually not a market .
but we do .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the force it .
they 're going to just the question : in which is that we do it on ?
how much money we 're in the <unk> ?
what do what we do for here ?
in which one of putting it run ?
and i personally , they have to be asked to something very personal to say , i 'm obviously in my <unk> <unk> , where i <unk> <unk> wanted to look at the big <unk> , <unk> has the little <unk> dead occur , it goes again , to rescue .
i was also think about greenpeace three years <unk> , when i sort of vancouver island is , and this whole <unk> <unk> 've seen , i was that <unk> that i there was doing .
and there was a <unk> about greenpeace , the money <unk> , and did n't know what you to make them and almost to actually gone .
there you me <unk> to the way to <unk> .
and i for three years greenpeace into a <unk> and now i 'm doing this in the hope , a future in the zeppelin .
zero , is this <unk> seconds , i 'm not yet done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , thank you .
that 's my three things that i want to <unk> minutes to me .
why we are today in <unk> or the abundance ?
how we come to <unk> ?
and most of all , what do ?
so what is it 's really ?
we start with our first thing .
the first part is perhaps a little <unk> .
but it 's a drum , the challenges to show .

that we have a problem now have to do every child .
that we are environmental problems .
but it 's worth it always been over time to that <unk> , are the challenges that population for example .
all kinds of <unk> is exponentially <unk> .
so it in a historical of view , the <unk> for example , and a very short episode in history to be .
and right now we can not imagine that there 's kind of different , when that <unk> again and keep up .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some people say , well , once there 's <unk> , let 's the last <unk> years .
so you can also <unk> look , <unk> ' i also true .
and you can say , who takes the glacier ?
and you can say , the ocean is far away .
but it 's then , if you look at a bit closer to it has to kind of the challenges , to things that it really want to avoid the , otherwise , we just getting the <unk> , the health .
<unk> does it 's a lot about 30 degrees .
and there 's degree , in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> , and increasingly more of bad .
it 's but also about the <unk> , especially in asia .
think of the himalayas , where the big streams <unk> and the <unk> of them on that there continuously water from the himalayas .
it 's all over the end not about the planet .
the planet is the <unk> , what we do , there was pretty much larger crisis .
and <unk> , but it 's about us to the people that sort of in a changed ecosystems , <unk> life .
it 's about loss of biodiversity .
the deserts wide , like .
this <unk> is less .
this is the aral sea , where a <unk> part of cotton comes .
and all this is that come from ?
this all bad things , say `` well , hanging in the one or another form of the global <unk> together .
with the , what we all of the earth go , what we harvest .
not just that the oil and the metals and the minerals , but those renewables resources are a <unk> , but over the scarce .
and we should just look at that we so little as much of use to be over the less food and emissions to produce .
so it 's about that 's in the <unk> been told by the <unk> really dramatically to reduce .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just , o two , <unk> from a car on a different but really different .
unlike the economies .
our technology , completely new .
if we have time to look at the <unk> and collector , and there are still on earth societies that in principle of life , come with a ton resources in the year per person and year .
in a <unk> , then in the longest time of human history , three to five tons .
today , it fifteen to <unk> .
so <unk> , this <unk> .
and he 's very , was over the earth .
it 's in north more than with us with us more than the earth , portable .
and in other parts of the world , and look in africa , much less .
and to come , we <unk> the impact on us , the rivers , the air is much better become the last decades , but it 's in essence of that we in other parts of the shift .
and the other parts of the world , the but less and like .
and because of the conflict that we see , from <unk> , is to afghanistan , where they look at them on the <unk> of american geological survey , and then you see where the resources from .
and this is there is there are particularly <unk> , which means that there are many resources , where the <unk> the world .
so if we have to <unk> , then we need to the subject <unk> .
so we have to change , the ecological limits 're everywhere , the <unk> is everywhere .
and this , what we 're going to <unk> life , it 's not <unk> .
this has been the mahatma gandhi stood up as he said , the world has enough for <unk> needs , but not for <unk> greed .
and there 's us , like us here on average life has been a lot about it .
so .
this was the sort <unk> part .
but i always that you have the needs to understand it 's worth , what to change .
so i later would say , it 's worth it also like that way to live , which is more <unk> .
but it 's and again , from the <unk> <unk> you need but a rationale , say `` i time .
so , what 's actually <unk> ?
and we have to find that we 're in our to share the world as much to have economically , <unk> the quality of living and us on average often do n't comfortable .
here 's a pretty good mood , but there are people , and you know sure that people that not so good deal , with this story .
i 've ever been there .
<unk> and climate change the same cause .
we work too much and to do .
this is on the one we get yourself in stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i work too much like .
and on the other hand , we just this <unk> .
but what is then a good life ?
how do we define ?
this is a a scientific <unk> .
the , what i 've been said , and what i later , let 's scientific , <unk> , but here is it 's a drum , as i can do this sort first of defining ?
and there is important to understand of life has always two aspects .
of life has the aspect of the objective conditions as i 'm doing , what i to eat .
i was a roof over the head ?
i friends ?
i relationship , i can the life to participate in ?
but just as well , as we go to me to how do ' i myself in order to ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the perceived of life .
and then <unk> ' i two terms bring that look at the point important .
this one 's needs .
the needs are the very fundamental to our human development , our there 's drum , to feelings .
if we need satisfy , then we 're happy .
and needs of you can not saying , needs are unsustainable or not sustainable .
the needs , se 're not yet , <unk> .
what 's needs ?
you can be a quote , i 'm here just two called .
and you see , of the physical needs , but also need for safety , social relations .
for protection , to participation , <unk> , creativity , spirituality , for freedom .
it has a bit about what money to do .
but a big part of actually do n't know , but the question is how can i told me that in my life up .
and there i looked at the second important term .
the strategy .
the strategy that i 'm going to me at stands for me that needs to fulfill .
and there 's then the drum , that i can sort of high <unk> or with a low <unk> do .
because i can be much money need a little money need .
strategies that are just to behave like i mean needs <unk> .
this did with my values to do with the resources , with the possibilities that i .
so much money , i 'm ' i put my needs to try to satisfy as if i sort of money on my account .
it 's all around the <unk> , this is the roof over the head , to eat , and then sort of the <unk> .
and here 's the drum , that can with much or a little <unk> that can kind of sustainable , or <unk> .
and if we all the strategies that i look at standing in my needs to satisfy , <unk> then let 's a lifestyle .
so .
this was the kind of scientific <unk> .
and now we go drum what we can do now ?
what 's how do this ?
and just some evidence .
now have this kind of course , everybody , myself .
but the evidence to the individual way on a technological way , here is , <unk> ' i , much also about technology , spoken by and also on a political way .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what do we do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides the beginning , sort , the danger is that we sort of more and a more resources to use .
so after all the quality , <unk> because the effects that keeps getting worse , , and on us at the back to beat .
or if we do it , sort 's in a different direction , the with less <unk> , maybe even with less energy consumption but with a higher quality of this connected .
there 's one of my <unk> you know him some , <unk> of <unk> of this topic <unk> , so more of life with less <unk> .
there 's a lot about technology as i can each one thing that we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee the car , the traffic , as i can that produce ?
<unk> i can now they produce , i can the house of wood , <unk> etc .
to deal with a lot less <unk> more or the quality .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> has this way , the <unk> per <unk> , and there 's us to , which is also have time <unk> been , there 's very deep gone on the company to look .
where are actually the needs ?
what they can i really satisfy ?
and how can i do with more little <unk> do ?
and it 's not a bit less but with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there 's many examples of this sort of .
in vienna , a tower being built to deal with 20 <unk> .
with seven <unk> is it in <unk> already built .
this in essence of wood is .
so you , if you might be in fifty years , no longer need to break , and then again in the pieces and not , so , very much less resources used with everything else , where you can sort of the moment with a half and the goal is a fifth of <unk> , the <unk> of the house that with this fifth of <unk> long .
it 's but also a lot in our own , sort of how <unk> ' i really ?
<unk> <unk> has a book written , <unk> .
where he shows , how hard it over the end is sort of really out of the sort of this <unk> to .
the <unk> , i do sort <unk> the others come , and then i 'm sort forever in this in this race in .
you yourself , sort <unk> that i quickly <unk> , and then find ' i the new .
the nicest <unk> ' i the <unk> that you know about all .
when i institute , got a few years we have letters written .
then you have sort 're able to the letter back to write `` i <unk> email , is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
to write `` i hundreds of emails .
and i 'm very much longer afford .
this is productivity , this is economic growth , we 're going to go back .
but i did n't really have saved .
i have to me to <unk> done .
but there 's good examples , slow food , where i really sort of the claim the quality and the claim the <unk> in the foreground .
and with a low <unk> more of life create .
one of my favorite is <unk> .
there 's <unk> now there 's how to <unk> average person with us in germany , in austria , about <unk> things at home .
can you start to count .
you are two years , three generations <unk> things , had employees , personal .
they have us who managed .
we need to myself with <unk> .
and fewer people come to make sure , with these all options .
and need a guides that allows us that does that allows us to <unk> with those few things <unk> .

so next example is , rather have .
a real boom .
star , <unk> , <unk> 's sort maybe about 20 years of in the alternatives are evolved by .
in the meantime , it more people , if you think about <unk> thinking .
if you think about <unk> thinking .
platforms that business models that easy to work , how do you the things we already have this beautiful <unk> here , a few hundred years ago was built , sort of and more about the other centuries to use that we go over the end .
so what , even invested was just getting to use .
this is over the end , a question of justice .
i gave them before that sort of it was that 's take them as the image from africa and europe and a <unk> world .
of that all the same time with these resources <unk> can 's only then possible , if we clearly not use .
and that is just not less of life , because a lot of us <unk> been sort of .
but it 's an important to the economy , the company , these products , those services really at the we need to a good life to create a lot less resources .
last thing that has also something with one of politics to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i think of the time .
if you a little attention to make predictions are , it 's been over the oecd , <unk> , now this <unk> every week , these predictions back to go down <unk> .
it means , yes , a crisis is the door to my view , after the , what we sort of the economists 've been talking and so busy , here are the numbers of austria , you find this is for all countries that growth , just looking down .
and there 's no reason for growth , so , like this out of my youth , from the <unk> years know .
the part of this in math reasons .
one point five percent growth is so much like eight percent growth and fifty years .
and that eight percent is that , what china today .
they 're also about there , where we might think of fifty years .
and when the pie bigger , is of heavy and again eight percent <unk> .
this one percent is still a , so we 're good <unk> .
but you have to sort on to hire so , not even if we zero percent growth , would be that , the next year just as much to produce and consume and income , like this year .
we can be investing and so we can work .
this is also is why not so <unk> , because you these statistics have to show the growth is already for `` no longer with the quality .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in the <unk> countries around the state , we are .
and by the jobs are also with no growth possible and that 's not so closely , like that gives us again and of <unk> and how they 're called <unk> .
it 's just not and then you have to the time with the economy <unk> .
and it 's coming again and and more that 's also <unk> the format , or next week , <unk> ' i , in coming in the trend , a larger story with this topic start to <unk> .
already <unk> , edward <unk> , the <unk> nobel prize in its <unk> so <unk> that he said , the good life the good business , `` the economy <unk> <unk> the good life .
so we go over the end up and not about not primarily about the returns to create , not primarily about growth to do what we are n't even more .
for <unk> and these countries , for china , for india there 's the <unk> very different story .
and this is just think you are also under <unk> , if we can sort of to grow and we just sort of this level , on this high level , we 're good to live and economies .
and it 's also , politics .
it takes goals .
it takes <unk> , say the economists .
it does not just kind of the growth , but we should really look and measure and ask , what about all , with the quality , goes up the ?
is the down ?
and also our politicians can measure .
of course , the way up is the <unk> ?
how do this sort together ?
we need an essence of which is that <unk> finally , <unk> and not the work .
of you in the entrepreneurs , but also the employees , you know this very good .
what kind of control walk away , we know about a colleague paid .
it could you very different .
the resources are some sort reduced and so among the resources <unk> and not the work .
and you have been the end of <unk> <unk> about engagement to create , to <unk> to <unk> , health , infrastructure without growth .
this is , but you have to a little have .
so , conclusion , more or less , at all levels , in this direction it worked , we have , we can be a company the products , services for consumers of us to ask what we need in fact , how do we make the what 's kind of good for us ?
what we need and what do we may not ?
the policy on the framework set .
some clues i did .
and over the end of the science <unk> percent of <unk> 's still in the direction , like , we can grow <unk> ?
, but unfortunately , none done .
if you see the predictions about if you see the development at the last 20 years ago , it 's always looking down because it goes .
the politics does n't and the <unk> wo n't grow to create , but this is the question how we go to be about , and it 's so that we have a good life of them ?
so , <unk> we do it .
be the <unk> you <unk> to lake .
with heart , brain , hand and over the end , <unk> we 're going to need .
thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this town .
this town , so many stories to tell .
one of it 's a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
this creative problem-solving i get right , and on the story about later .
they 're going to do with the fortress <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> , here in the middle of the city is , and lots of that city , like and <unk> .
another story before .
it was at a hot <unk> in <unk> , nevada .
a man notice how , at once in his shoes , right to get it <unk> .
for him to warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that 's not the heat .
he 's so one he pulls the shoe , take a knife <unk> also not long <unk> in , and it 's a power in a lot of holes in .
he pulls the shoe back to have to be a knife , and notice it has a climate in shoe .
it 's a shoe , the <unk> , born .
and this number that you see here 's the point in the <unk> the <unk> at the morton <unk> today .
a company is <unk> born , with four letters .
the one or another kind of you know it .
he has the original idea , nike and <unk> offered .
both have to be .
so he says , well , <unk> , i do my own company .
<unk> it to the market .
trying to several thousand employees in just <unk> business in over <unk> countries in the world .
so much for the creative problem-solving .
why not something to make , what do n't there is ?
and morton , perhaps the question is that with <unk> <unk> .
if you <unk> have n't know , it stands for which is an opportunity ?
this question that was already too often been , in difficult situations .
if something wrong did , or my <unk> <unk> me or technology does n't or whatever .
<unk> , little memory , <unk> .
what is an opportunity ?
and it comes to the <unk> into <unk> .
what the difference can <unk> ' i with this example here to illustrate .
and another example , from the <unk> <unk> collected , and it 's the <unk> statements of <unk> .
and the core evidence of creative people can be , if it about their own insurance .
i want to some examples here .
who are so in fact that <unk> the <unk> <unk> and that has it also a <unk> .
i <unk> on the amazing .
my son has the woman 's not <unk> .
he 's just <unk> , about this is the woman through the <unk> <unk> .
or i had all the day of where i was the intersection , who grew up all the bush into my <unk> and i was the vehicle that .
very clear , who it fault , right ?
the bush .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> been and two times , almost died .
because they can tell me , but at this half <unk> on .
the last i was at the crash n't blame .
fault , the young woman in <unk> .
if you a man , is one another explanation obsolete .
but if you a woman , you know it anyway .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish and i dream of that we all the more of creativity .
a lot of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and this must not be that .
why do things just a different ?
old things that we do that 's routine become , that we may have bored , or <unk> the opposite .
why are not just a way you do that <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there are so <unk> company , the use this .
so , <unk> that , but these <unk> from their run , these signs , or at the wall , and there 's think you might be so what it .
also a way , right ?
let the coffee to stay instead of the <unk> .
or so what .
we have no <unk> , <unk> you .
is today , <unk> , right ?
if you the mobile not something <unk> .
or eat them with me , otherwise starvation we both .
<unk> , but creative .
that does it .

this <unk> ' i like .
a <unk> <unk> has in the <unk> the current <unk> <unk> , and it in <unk> .
once the sport , the current news , one policy .
so if there three times on the <unk> was , you <unk> .
even got the complaint about a long <unk> the food .
it 's a <unk> building and that a very small , so had the chefs all of hands of to do .
it was to look closely .
they 're thinking about , collectively , what we do ?
how do we the problem ?
we can not going to the kitchen .
this idea is born .
to table , a <unk> <unk> <unk> set fresh <unk> salt , pepper and a <unk> .
so that , the <unk> 's going to wait to actually eat your <unk> been a piece <unk> .
just a different .
a creative idea , and maybe even with the <unk> solved .
there 's a person who makes it is not just popular .
and this person is the leader of <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .
and out <unk> , the german <unk> .
in the second day , it takes a monday , four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> the staff of the month elected , and you know , perhaps , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you .
the people come to us <unk> <unk> .
the buses are full , it 's <unk> run , people together in <unk> because each of the other ways in , from a to b .
but why do n't even as well out to use and creative from his disadvantage do something ?
sometimes it happens , creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> might find out , like this company that you may know .
so we have you know that there are the <unk> n't really well , but you to the <unk> also about saving to 's something <unk> .
or the <unk> the car .
because we know , the different , <unk> , and all directions .
yes .
why do n't have to a piece bacon the car on , if you <unk> is ?
or at <unk> 's also some ways to the creative .
and all that has to do just with humor , with joy , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son to the office .
and sitting on this <unk> to me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the <unk> .
and then turn it from left to right , he happy , and i in my <unk> <unk> say , to you , listen to that 's not a playground .
he said to , look at me , big eyes , playground .
and the moment <unk> ' i actually did he 's right ?
why is not a playground .
why is this is what we do is not the playground for adults ?

if we relaxed , if we our talents to use to do that , what we love to do .
and <unk> get , but it relaxed .
this <unk> is that if a particular day of the week , then might we going on our brains .
it 's the first day in the week , and it 's our focus on one other day .
so one other day , we usually prefer .
so towards the weekend .
so you know , already in the media .
the <unk> is yes , just have a day to the weekend .
or if then the most beautiful time of announced , the vacation .
what are then the rest of <unk> weeks of ?
it 's so awful ?
we all this horrible jobs ?
a <unk> had this time on the front , this topic .
yes , monday can ' i and the rest of you ask yourself .
or on <unk> , on facebook , anywhere in the social networks , this topic <unk> .
once <unk> i went through the <unk> , one of <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a business and i took me the like .
what have the way in the <unk> , what 's there ?
and one day <unk> i think of this business with these <unk> to buy .
and so the sign that you see here , yes , that 's actually quite nice .
so , with this love to do instead to work .
i <unk> that yes , my father of five children , but i love , my work by now .
yes .
or a <unk> for <unk> is the <unk> sign .
why it 's mindset that 's degree <unk> , and it 's always be more and forth .
somebody was there 's just as an answer to the direction posted it 's not a monday , it 's your jobs .
and i 'm even in the pink glasses , here forward to come and say , okay , ' time <unk> .
what to my job is beautiful ?
so stupid , even if it the pink glasses , it 's all right away from the way before .
so a nice to talk , that you is that 's obviously not .
the pink glasses , by the great for a bike drive .
there 's got them a wonderful to fly , who else in your land .
but to <unk> <unk> they do n't .
where is this , if we do n't change ?
in the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside of <unk> .
it ends maybe in a system where we like us feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this bike , and walking and walking and walking , and eventually it 's too fast , this bike you get the poor mouse and they <unk> out .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know , nothing else , she goes back in the <unk> .
and again , and again , perhaps the film that <unk> the <unk> you know , after all of them , soft .
this is beautiful <unk> here with hay , so they do , yes , <unk> and it 's and again that 's gone .
and this , what we as funny feel that has the mouse at a concussion , yeah ?
or something needs it that <unk> <unk> .
i 's many years ago , when i went on was a seminar home .
and on to be turned out of the streets of me , i felt it was completely black and my eyes and somehow got ' i stand .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , what you go ?
he <unk> me , and i said no way that 's physically everything in order .
but as if it with the <unk> like ?
and i looked in my calendar , and to check , and saw , i was three weeks , and somehow <unk> me also the job .
after 20 years in the <unk> and collaborator , the first of the early been wondering whether we look at night before , can do .
i also meant that 's actually else for jobs ?
and i started , <unk> , again other priorities to , to see that i was time with my family <unk> , something good for me for doing .
<unk> , whether it 's not <unk> other <unk> are in my job , a new <unk> .
i 've that 's a large groups that make me the joy .
i do ' , as a counseling and <unk> and other things , but that 's <unk> give to , to share , they 're going to really happy .
and that was n't always like .
i gave myself to do that <unk> stress sick .
and sometimes it 's really this <unk> in the front and so , <unk> of me 's degree , from the hospital by , after he got a heart attack had , and on this is he also , <unk> .
i used as i said , you leave with <unk> , he was always <unk> , you with your running and so .
now it themselves .
so , with <unk> , you slowly , in real <unk> , but eventually we 're also share <unk> go .
what happens ?
the bottom line , and healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve , of , is the diseases , <unk> health .
<unk> minus four percent in the <unk> last 10 years , <unk> about minus fifty percent , it 's nice , this is less .
rise of mental disorders plus <unk> percent .
this is something , where i think , that ?
why is that ?
it 's just in austria ?
no , in germany , it .
<unk> , <unk> that 's all healthier .
this is so here on the to see .
it down psychiatric disorders , plus a hundred percent within the last 10 years , finds a a german <unk> out .
the number <unk> psychiatric drugs , too .
the cost .
and i think of all kinds of official , what we can do with this subject ?
make some suggestions sometimes you get to make it <unk> <unk> , for example here .
so it 's good meaning .
and somebody was once said , no alcohol 's not a solution .
but what 's then the solution ?
what is then it , what we go back healthy , and it and with happiness is ?
and that i was the last few years busy .
i think that 's something like <unk> , it 's something like at all be ?
i 'm <unk> , the job is not that , what we <unk> it and you do .
there are many other things that matters , family , health , and so forth .
but in fact is , we 're going to the part of <unk> in the work spend .
and if we do that , why do n't it 's how do that there are joyful <unk> and also by another .
the <unk> <unk> ' i 'm going to <unk> , when i 'll offer to <unk> and for <unk> to .
these little <unk> that you can then easier to notice .
<unk> stands for art <unk> , and environment .
so , how <unk> ' i mean talents ?
in which environment , `` i think this , with whom ?
the freedom was ' i 'm here , it to do what i 'm going to do ?
because it 's the degree of <unk> that allows us <unk> .
the more of the more stress .
and what do i make it ?
the <unk> .
for that are these four areas .
and it can now , there check .
i had this for me for see a few years , and i do this <unk> and again .
can i mean talents to use ?
in which environment ?
and so , sometimes you go in a coffee with my laptop , to the seminar prepare or a <unk> .
the freedom .
the freedom , i take to do that , which brings me .
and stop ! i 've also ?
the <unk> .
the last u .
and then there 's it again and people to me explain why do n't it goes .
and why this with them much harder .
then i usually just like an answer at this point .
who wants to find ways .
who does n't know , has reasons .
and certainly in the point , you pick <unk> ' i ways to find ' i ways , i ' i reasons why ?
and they 're in both right .
what do we do with our talent ?
each of them has his great <unk> <unk> .
it 's too small .
it 's filled with a talent , gold , with all sorts of their skills .
what we do it ?
by the <unk> we ask ourselves that .
or if we in hospital in or the end of life .
what i did with my talent doing ?
by , who 's like , on <unk> <unk> , like to afterwards , access .
so , what we do with our talent , is so my first question , even at me ask yourself , and that every day .
<unk> ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was yet another thing with a story .
so i tell you wanted to <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i believe in the place to do .
these fortress which was the salvation of the <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , who are coming .
and the enemies realized that these fortress so good built was that you do n't take .
thick walls <unk> ways of the <unk> the fortress , the doors , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
was <unk> back .
so we thought , the following , okay if we do n't <unk> , then , we have a <unk> .
we let 's no longer out and in .
you look how long , that there <unk> .
the <unk> kept it from long until the day , where the <unk> almost used .
they had just have a <unk> who was already on the way to <unk> to be as the <unk> on one time for <unk> says , <unk> give me that <unk> and give me three days .
<unk> okay , <unk> , you see you time , i <unk> ' you , come to take the <unk> and <unk> us .
<unk> going to the <unk> way .
on a look at the enemies how about the wall of the fortress a <unk> pulled it led to go back from left to right and already in the early .
well , think that , a <unk> , what it .
it 's <unk> .
it 's a <unk> <unk> , up on the wall of the fortress , this is he was black .
are thinking , oh , still has two <unk> , it can ' another thing to .
at night the scenario and again , this is he knows the <unk> , on and that led .
so at the second day , after the six different <unk> have seen at which they 're in a <unk> .
because they thought , it takes us too long , i think we ourselves that .
and then the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the one that you had and that they <unk> .
it 's the <unk> <unk> born .
i like this idea that everything else is what we need , and that we all .
sometimes it 's <unk> resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's much .
but also with that we can go to do something .
we have no idea of the power that we have the world every day to invent .
and if you believe that could now a good <unk> be then you have right .
in the spring from the spring .
the coming .
and we in <unk> know there is the snow and it 's warmer and catch the plants on the branches brown <unk> to green <unk> .
there are blooms at some form of these blooms fruit .
there are apples this very popular and then we harvest and eat .
there 's grain of this grain , we can then <unk> and bread make .
there any animals that eat .
there are people who then the products of it later .
and it comes automatically .
but if you think about that may not so and everything is then it 's a fear and <unk> .
and , of this is maybe just very <unk> and also a theoretical but just in the blooms of the connection of the flower to plant , bees a very , very large part .
there 's research that show that up to <unk> percent of our food , at food was n't there were if we do n't need bees .
the sounds , so <unk> , because it 's natural for us , and we need bees might also not so perceive .
there was going to some time a very interesting movie , <unk> , the subject .
and i recommend you , and it .
now , but look forward we focus on the gentleman <unk> of which is just about honeybees works , in high school , in <unk> the importance of bees and power .
it 's he 's a school in <unk> and he gets us now some of his work with you .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
it 's a big thanks to mr. <unk> and at the whole <unk> .
that i 'm here with my project , <unk> or <unk> to contribute to talk about the lives of bees .
and that , under a wing of <unk> something about a little <unk> to tell that 's fun .
because i suppose to that the least of you <unk> for , it would have now here tonight is a <unk> do it in <unk> minutes in the basics of beekeeping bring to do .
it should not me , no .
but maybe you get it me , you to you to these <unk> start to love or a certain empathy them over to develop and you to get this <unk> <unk> , <unk> insect the <unk> .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years of young , with a wonderful woman married , father of five kids have n't <unk> and have different <unk> and <unk> finished and work for <unk> years in the <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member of the <unk> <unk> and in <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> above the <unk> with our oldest students in <unk> .
we 're working there in the garden , in agriculture and in beekeeping .
<unk> 's actually a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and is about <unk> <unk> .
our flying classroom is more a <unk> , a silent , a steady .
and they will also the left alone .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and not free will have been the ancient greeks the relationship between the honey , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> know .
and in a wonderful verse of homer describes it looks like the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the <unk> 's out to him to inspire that it again with dense .
but the <unk> go there 's not myself down ; they send their blue bees and <unk> now that 's the lips , wax and they crawl into the mouth , and back out with him on the words , honey from the <unk> flow .
a beautiful picture .
i get me that this evening .
yes .
this flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of <unk> , this <unk> the just now my students with me , built have come for 30 to <unk> days in a <unk> .
in <unk> schools of us in <unk> into school or in the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> after <unk> .
a <unk> after <unk> or in <unk> with us in <unk> .
the teacher , this project with going to me in the class and we 're looking for a <unk> room for such a <unk> .
mostly the window to the kids that can see during this month .
and most of all things that the bees , then in there are the <unk> out and again <unk> .
there will then the window of <unk> created .
so .
and then , the whole for me on the <unk> .
i 'm so as a <unk> and <unk> ' now from an existing <unk> two <unk> out and <unk> you 're here in these <unk> inside .
it on this on this <unk> are <unk> so there .
also important , we have here <unk> <unk> , and here to the , fresh <unk> be , fresh eggs .
and then you also a <unk> , up here .
there 's the honey inside .
the need them , if a bad weather is and they do n't fly .
so .
here 's what it .
then it comes from the <unk> here again on and immediately , the transportation , for <unk> spaces , or at the reason for <unk> place in school .
and now starting a wonderful .
and gentlemen , bees and in the then in the class that experience of a crisis .
you people 's no longer .
they are lonely .
they find your queen 's not .
and this is the most important to the <unk> , when he had this <unk> make that it on <unk> that the queen of the old people are .
that 's not on these two <unk> is .
and they 're sad , the bees .
they 're starting to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , they <unk> .
you hear that .
they buzzing almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen together .
and now starting a <unk> .
and gentlemen , in one night , you 're now the need to a new people to form , and the whole thing happened without <unk> , <unk> , without conferences , without having conversations , without opinions and is .
here 's the people to agree and it then in the first night is a <unk> .
because without the queen , that people after six weeks , no longer exists .
because <unk> live in the only six weeks for .
so .
and in the first night bring them from one of <unk> a pencil out an egg , and bring it into this <unk> inside .
and there <unk> , then <unk> queen .
anyone who 's of you <unk> in the high school , says , how do this because they go ?
yes , all <unk> that 's all genetically <unk> .
this is true .
and now starting a wonderful .
this animal egg what 's normally in the <unk> a <unk> become would be in the <unk> a queen .
the egg , the first three days of the same genetic code of the <unk> .
and it 's going to fed a <unk> <unk> .
you know that term .
and immediately is changing on this <unk> on <unk> imagine the genetic code .
the <unk> going through the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> changed .
we had that i 've ever heard that what we eat , it determines what , from us .
and the queen 's really wonderful to experience .
three days , an egg , five days <unk> .
and that can the students all <unk> .
so you see in education .
and then becomes the cell <unk> with a <unk> wax and the whole thing happens then also not , because of the people now <unk> to <unk> or because one <unk> says , putting it be , or you <unk> a group , you do this now .
no , that happens <unk> .
and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> .
and then for the students eight days of my student knows , three to put a queen 's so <unk> days that the queen <unk> .
and the day , if it 's going to , the teacher 's the <unk> in the <unk> there <unk> the <unk> in the students in about five o'clock , yeah .
and says the mother , say , which is because with you go ?
now , i have to school .
yes , why because it ?
yes , the queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then they are the morning to six in school .
and then , that their <unk> down at this <unk> , because they <unk> want to the queen 's now <unk> .
and if you really what can then hear you first thing .
the queen <unk> .
so .
a bit higher .
and then get the <unk> and cutting the queen 's free .
the first , what the queen , they <unk> their wings , and are now with their <unk> that people what 's imagine ourselves a queen pulled out their <unk> , her <unk> , their <unk> .
the people who has now , an identity .
now , three to five days for the queen fed up .
the <unk> forward get them their <unk> <unk> .
the back from the <unk> out , from the people , from this <unk> .
and after five days is the queen <unk> from the <unk> out .
i think now , i 've ever seen , as a <unk> in <unk> .
wait , <unk> .
so different .
-- that we let me .
the queen 's going to do without <unk> , without <unk> , from this <unk> out to two miles up .
thank you probably already have seen in your zeppelin .
in the <unk> and will be there were in an <unk> now <unk> , of seven to 12 drones , the male bees .
so the way in islam is where the man different women have here is the queen , the seven to 12 men .
and it 's happening in a wonderful way in flight .
the drone is coming from the back <unk> the queen , and the queen collects now in an <unk> all that , you 're going to seed need to for three years eggs to put them .
for the drone is it also an amazing experience .
if you 've done is the <unk> dies , and falls are from the sky .
and then it comes from the queen back and starts to lay eggs to put them .
there 's always a , two students in the class , it immediately .
they 're also to the queen .
yes .
and ends , the project in school because now , the <unk> again <unk> and the queen and the <unk> is going to look closely in there .
and then come and one night and before to that <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> from outside , and the next morning <unk> ' i had this <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and here you have the queen .
yes .
fresh <unk> .
and around the 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then it comes from this , these two <unk> come from now here in a <unk> .
in a full cane , in a prey and now can see that people big and <unk> .
why bees in school ?
and gentlemen the kids that have to forget that no longer .
yes .
there 's not just that in this class , the students all the time with the bees flying together , but the entire school , yes into this class in .
and the teacher , if he was something you know , when he was something , when he if it 's something prepared the swami is a <unk> after the other join .
so , bees and <unk> <unk> ago <unk> years we <unk> where the people have the honey <unk> .
a few months , you in israel <unk> years old <unk> found in the people at the bees thought .
any human culture has about honeybees <unk> .
or vice versa , the bees were with any culture that .
in china , in india in <unk> , in egypt , in greece in rome .
all they were here .
the human culture and gentlemen , are passed .
he can a <unk> , a <unk> join me , he can a <unk> join .
and gentlemen , you know what the flowers , trees , the bees <unk> , what they do ?
that it out there 's something , now in summer in agriculture .
this out there , that 's a green desert to our bees .
yeah ?
he can tell ourselves with the students in the <unk> go and plants are bees <unk> , on <unk> them on and look , as long need the right now , from <unk> to my flowers .
how long they 're on the individuals blooms ?
and how long need them , until they decided to come back .
he can <unk> <unk> hold .
how <unk> i a <unk> ?
yes .
you know , whether this is that in the <unk> the top of the top , or <unk> flat on the top ?
so look at right down .
he can a math -- , a <unk> join .
yes , and gentlemen , he can deal with the students in the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> discover .
and then , he was to the question , how could karl of fresh <unk> the nobel prize for getting ?
because he thought , that the bees and see in the beehive .
but , and gentlemen , in a beehive it 's <unk> .
there 's also a bee has nothing .
and just the professor <unk> , many years in <unk> at the university teaching , has been in <unk> <unk> that the bees , there a <unk> create a single <unk> .
as a <unk> network of the wax in the <unk> a <unk> create , and now with <unk> hertz , <unk> there <unk> , and the bees , the <unk> to pick up with their legs , with their <unk> .
you see , what these bees in school ?
it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the kids lose your fear of the bees .
and develop a awareness of the bees .
they learn , <unk> , <unk> what the bees do .
and they get a <unk> of these creatures which basically , just for us human lives .
the bees do wax not even a kilo of a people in the year .
so <unk> years the only way , their candles make .
they accumulate in the <unk> out of the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , with the <unk> you people .
and now imagine a time ago , in summer , that 's <unk> -- that <unk> bees in such a tight room , <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's <unk> without end .
no , in the bees .
because they have in this <unk> natural antibiotics .
they accumulate the pollen , and you to him <unk> , he went to <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
someone who had to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> the can do a <unk> go and a <unk> prescribe , and the <unk> from the people <unk> .
so there 's a grid that and with <unk> with a <unk> and so , there 's nothing .
yes , and then and gentlemen , <unk> the <unk> do that the bees course , and we could have less apples , if the bees and do n't fly , or we 'd like the chinese of the <unk> <unk> and you yourself <unk> .
there 's a lot more <unk> .
so look at the <unk> , there on the meadow 's also the growing up the <unk> where the cows graze .
and there is the bee down , at the nectar and <unk> these <unk> .
and this is the cow and <unk> the <unk> and just because it <unk> <unk> <unk> , it can digest .
yeah ?
and then <unk> it again and notice , ah , i <unk> <unk> , ah , i can make it again <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yeah ?
and , but <unk> the bee 's the <unk> what it on the out of nature .
the honey .
so i 'll just want to the point , <unk> .
my students look forward , every year when you see these <unk> build and then partly to put together in the schools .
that 's going to my <unk> but once i had a student , and i said in <unk> in school in <unk> and i said , you , <unk> ' <unk> you yourself .
and then he says , so , i hot ' <unk> <unk> .
i come from <unk> at <unk> and i 'm twenty years .
and i 've been five years in <unk> and for two years ago when thomas in <unk> .
and i <unk> ' me that i 'm not be with the <unk> learn to , but with the hands learn .
<unk> , yes , with the head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , <unk> school .
and more than half the said , oh yeah , that we want to be .
my students to experience is a <unk> appreciation and the <unk> between , in <unk> , normal and the <unk> people get through the bees <unk> .
on <unk> face , and they get self-esteem , my students and a proud .
how come to the bee ?
the question is wrong .
you would say , how come you to <unk> the <unk> ?
and i think , i , there 's the person who 's the other people <unk> and him a new <unk> there .
and he says , so , do with it .
so at a poem by <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee is the sun comes through the <unk> feel the way to the flower , and never the direction lose the <unk> the fields in <unk> a gleam in the way , he also , he would ever cry .
thank you .
hello , dear friends on earth .
welcome to the presentation of my project .
the project of person and my wife .
it 's the struggle for an end of the female genital mutilation .
in my view the greatest crimes of humanity , because it <unk> been <unk> years .
the society against the women with still <unk> out a day .
first <unk> ' i imagined .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
and i <unk> for a <unk> run .
so you can think that me to do n't <unk> .
i did n't <unk> .
and so i was happy that i in the subject <unk> good <unk> and exciting govern <unk> .
so for this .
with a massive <unk> about the atlantic of africa , brazil .
on the <unk> a <unk> to the <unk> brazil , <unk> genocide in the last <unk> indians the <unk> , to prevent .
this was a ride , where i more <unk> 's when <unk> , more <unk> as <unk> .
anyway , like that govern suited to the interest in the media to find and even a person as i was his cause in the language .
<unk> i did with my own <unk> the <unk> in ethiopia <unk> .
there was in war between <unk> and ethiopia and we were <unk> of the killings there .
and despite all cruelty , we <unk> , <unk> we on the other side of the infinity hospitality of <unk> that allow us <unk> <unk> , arab hospitality .
and twice happened there is we invaded , and our two <unk> that you see here , with their bodies as living <unk> of us <unk> , and the <unk> said that 's my <unk> .
if you to kill you have to her out of them shoot .
something like i was in any other culture found .
and then in boys , 've learned that you islam is not reduce can get to terrorism .
that christians want to do n't be reduced to their terrorism .
so for the <unk> .
the <unk> that <unk> .
but rather on the real value of <unk> , social responsibility for the <unk> .
these are the values , for that it 's worth to fight .
after many years i come back in this <unk> been , together with my wife <unk> .
and there were we then from that <unk> female genital mutilation .
when i think you heard that <unk> percent of everyday victims <unk> are the rest of these christians and <unk> got ' i thought about how can a <unk> like that islam , besides all terror , this <unk> in the shoes out of them ?
and the idea was born in the highest quality of islam to the practice to sin .
we were looking for <unk> in german organizations who did n't we found .
because we had to us and listen to now if we may be completely <unk> that islam is n't <unk> .
you 'd like me the <unk> <unk> .
on <unk> of <unk> internationally , we then <unk> our own organization , .
and were from <unk> and <unk> independently .
and now this is also the way to do we needed images .
it was a lack of .
and so moved <unk> and i went back into this desert to deal with <unk> camera these images .
the bad bloody pictures that i 'm going to do n't know , but i want to the crime <unk> .
girl at age of four weeks to wedding be at some of their parents and related <unk> in the earth put it sits down on the limbs , and <unk> them with no <unk> the clitoris and the <unk> off <unk> with a <unk> the <unk> to , without <unk> with <unk> instruments , <unk> of <unk> and anatomy and the <unk> putting <unk> .
what you left is a <unk> of the size of <unk> .
<unk> is now one <unk> .
if you usually have <unk> you two weeks .
unimaginable destroyed the body and soul , <unk> their dignity .
this was the so-called <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> go on .
the man has to you open .
he did have never been a <unk> woman .
the <unk> have him , oh , ibrahim that 's no problem .
you <unk> your penis , <unk> one and then at you very hard .
and if you do n't it <unk> that 's not bad .
then take you knives and <unk> you on .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and dies a third of girls .
so you had to three months <unk> .
in shock , the girl his speech .
these are the <unk> , some in asia .
the most are <unk> govern .
and whenever we muslims said , why did you do that ?
was the <unk> answer that we have to do , this is in the koran .
nothing is in the of all the opposite .
everybody believers <unk> five times a day in prayer , like <unk> <unk> , the creator , is perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't want to believe , what you know .
they <unk> <unk> , a <unk> to be the women being created , and why you well as <unk> human <unk> could , of women <unk> .
but now we had the images of the first <unk> was this <unk> .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there was the discussions , two days for .
but we had the minister of our side that highest <unk> on our side .
and then came the great decision , the practice is against all human rights , against the religion , we need to ban them .
as recently , the way <unk> this new <unk> signed .
and if you africa and the <unk> know , do you , only that has to these people valid .
and it was being celebrated and these successes we had then also in other countries .
quick example , <unk> there <unk> us the highest <unk> , the <unk> of his message that there 's a crime , on <unk> to write and now in the <unk> to wear .
for we were on , with your <unk> .
a hundred <unk> we had to .
and where we came , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical fact , saints hospitality of .
and when we the country at some of wanted , the great scholar and <unk> <unk> , you 're really all <unk> countries in the ?
so much lifetime will <unk> you , no longer .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> and you have slow to the thing .
and , he had an idea .
he said , if you get to 10 <unk> muslims in the world to a table to and explain the practice to sin , it is a sin .
<unk> and i went to <unk> in the <unk> and -- mosque <unk> with the <unk> the <unk> .
and in <unk> for <unk> quite the <unk> , his <unk> professor doctor ali <unk> we got a <unk> .
he stopped at the idea that was thrilled , especially , when we gave him <unk> that we pay for .
and we do that just about <unk> that allow us .
and then he said , i 'm going to the conference is not just <unk> , as we get it being asked , but i 'm going to the <unk> play .
and that he did .
over <unk> <unk> sometime in <unk> our transparent .
international <unk> to go on the <unk> of the female body through circumcision .
the <unk> of <unk> professor doctor ali <unk> .
and they are coming .
a hundred <unk> , but the highest the world .
in the middle of <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg and the rest of europe he 's the cause of <unk> because of cartoons .
so men who life and decide .
but just the other .
on the <unk> <unk> , right to the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest the world .
about where i 'm <unk> me just have a vacuum , and <unk> personally .
and then i did you all <unk> .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at <unk> from left <unk> from egypt .
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> egypt , <unk> a woman mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much for the subject of islam is not <unk> .
we had a medical <unk> the on their way , and again <unk> do is terrible things you are there <unk> , with the <unk> .
and then they could <unk> your film , <unk> .
reality .
the men had <unk> eyes .
they look back behind <unk> doors to just two hours of you had decided and a <unk> , a <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> in the cameras , <unk> , what we decided .
and the sentence in this was this .
female genital mutilation is a <unk> crime and the highest values of islam <unk> .
he <unk> the <unk> .
we thought , the job is done , but the bill without our <unk> .
because the shame , the <unk> the woman to talk , is more stayed when everybody .
so we <unk> .
we have that we have the conference documented in this so-called golden rule book .
a <unk> for the <unk> this world .
and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it as well , the book , he 's a <unk> blessed .
it gets us from the hands <unk> .
we were in many countries had to then conferences hold the one of <unk> .
and you read that to think there were so excited about them to the book <unk> .
sadly , but have the most of the courage <unk> , it also to that .
the <unk> the wife gets to do n't in the mosque .
just some of the courage <unk> .
they 're at least in the universities went to <unk> .
and sometimes we have a bold <unk> found that actually in the mosque about <unk> , like here .
and then it goes out of speakers in the <unk> .
and these are we are affected .
they 're doing it .
but i 'm going out of time .
there are all of the hot rocks , and so i believe in many other strategy , this topic , <unk> .

i know yet , as we always before the fence stood up and waited until these people , because , somehow we look like people to us , and that 's look at the important .
after two years , finally my father , in germany .
the problem , but that it directly from <unk> after <unk> <unk> , because it <unk> supposedly no place , for him .
i <unk> ' me of the very , <unk> lawyer , it did , my father before the <unk> to china to keep us they made it even that it with us in <unk> housing for .
i <unk> ' me of this time where i really think you very , very happy , because after six years <unk> could we finally in a normal apartment .
we got a <unk> for three years and we had finally , your home with one of bad and one of your kitchen .
and i even had a room .
it was a very small and i did n't have a desk in , but it was fine , i could my door <unk> .
and i <unk> ' me that i 'm the time , very good for , but i had yet the <unk> without a closing leave .
i looked for me really no way .
there was a <unk> that makes me in <unk> , who has and it 's still doing on the idea that i 'm talking about the second <unk> my degrees <unk> .
first <unk> then the <unk> .
so much the teacher who really want to me thought , and i was really not just the time i made it even the middle <unk> .
and i came to <unk> .
and before i went to <unk> was playing the way with my best friend <unk> at <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project of organized <unk> .
but i was a <unk> that i ' i also have done because we 're going through <unk> a place , where we just go .
we had a <unk> what we <unk> <unk> .
and the ladder of <unk> helped us some way that we have to tell you could and he <unk> us and was able to the questions of <unk> .
and then i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project , where young people without a going to get to <unk> <unk> .
it was really quite well done , and i 've , art is something which brings me a little <unk> .
by <unk> and the contact with <unk> got a filmmaker on us .
he made the film <unk> over the lives of my friends and me .
and the movie won a lot of prices .
we realized that people in our story interested .
he was a very special feeling , because we have never experienced , that people 's listening .
and this was such a moment , where i thought , okay .
i do n't want more <unk> .
i do anything from my life .
a <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees came to focus on the idea for a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
but since i in the <unk> building me , running , i ended up to be in a <unk> for a <unk> and the title is <unk> one or four .
so i was right .
i was playing with .
and the great is , after a performance two editors from <unk> <unk> on me <unk> .
and asked me , if i think would just my own <unk> .
i thought , super , <unk> .
now , `` i with .
and i made for the <unk> <unk> , pulse <unk> and one of posts about a <unk> <unk> , where i also ourselves <unk> was for the european <unk> <unk> .
and i put it 's actually won .
by studying i want to college for <unk> and movie <unk> <unk> already in the third year and i 'm <unk> the <unk> .
and it would have to do n't been if not one or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> well , i used .
they have to me thought they 've got me spaces open , they have to ways that , as i quit my place in the society , <unk> .
and come ' i 'm going to them .
each of you have the possibility of people like me to help the second chance to get and their lives or their place in the society .
because that people , you come <unk> hundred refugees in <unk> and each of you 're full of hope and each of you have a huge potential .
they have it with big determination to many terrible hurdles behind them .
and with this determination , you could really big profit in germany , and for every single one of us .
and i could actually a thousand things to tell you can do , but because i had no longer enough time , though there is , a minute fifty years , i put them a <unk> brought .
<unk> , your phone out they can i did n't tell you to no code <unk> .
scan it the code , and then they come on the side of <unk> with a lot suggestions , what they <unk> can do .
and that would allow us very good .
i <unk> me now have time for their engagement and we see us out hope .
and scan it the code .
i <unk> ' it .
many have the mobile not in my hand .
you are so <unk> , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> yes .
just a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> me that we can touch .
my name is robin .
my <unk> is write a simpler than it talks .
i come on in austria , this is in vienna .
i <unk> ' i still very , today in <unk> be able to that 's beautiful here .
i <unk> me here every time very comfortable .
and this is not just that 's a sense .
yes , yes , to the other <unk> i 'm not here today , to you about anything to <unk> .
i did n't know , which .
but it 's so that i was writing write in my play and then there somewhere talk , mostly in <unk> <unk> or <unk> or just <unk> like the world .
yes , and i was also going to be here a couple of writing to read to the program a little <unk> .
and that 'll ' i 'm doing here .
yes .
i start with a joke .
make the two chicken .
says that 's so , are two english chickens i <unk> you and <unk> 's not <unk> , but <unk> been a very funny i <unk> you and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
says the other yeah .
hey <unk> ca n't <unk> me .
here we would have the level <unk> .
so the text is a little <unk> that i just wrote was .
i said , it was a person dedicated to me partly because what does .
it carries the title <unk> .
and yes , they did it back on did n't understand .
when your head in my lap was slept under your rest of my ceiling .
my leg was also under my ceiling your leg was outside the ceiling .
my leg got on for the ceiling .
it 's about your head is to hold on my lap <unk> , the rest of her the ceiling , my leg , under the ceiling , your leg outside the ceiling .

it was very romantic .
the text i also look at a person dedicated to me very much does .
and it 's my grandpa .
we 've since no contact .
my <unk> grandfather had a profession <unk> .
and as a it with love <unk> cut .
go to me that , yeah .
yes , <unk> text .
it 's going to do n't .
jesus is the only <unk> 's standing on the <unk> at the glass of <unk> .
but where was jesus as he told me before that <unk> <unk> `` save them ?
there to think , yeah ?
i mean <unk> been brought ?
next text .
so the text is a little longer .
he is actually a few hours .
so to write .
're going faster .
is the start by a novel that i degrees in the <unk> write .
ah , it 's about <unk> guys , so those adventures from a guy who , again and the hair <unk> and a little too much <unk> .
i <unk> ' , but again and at this point of the <unk> i themselves .
because i <unk> ' i never the hair <unk> .
chapter one .
if i <unk> is my head abandoned .
as abandoned like the sheet , that 's going to fill tried .
yes , and i 'm not .
very hard a few hours .
so the text is also a little <unk> .
most people do n't it .
i stop ! ' i found ourselves too hard .
and it is that , i play , like to my vocabulary and with my language .
i ' always been to me on .
and yes , then get hold these things out .
it carries the title <unk> .
is a little bit strange yet <unk> .
is probably the <unk> <unk> that i 've written got .
<unk> we can .
yes , we really .
we all can .
we <unk> .
but i ca n't .
but i can 's .
i can not .
i can not .
yes , i did it yourself also did n't understand .
no idea .
yes , <unk> of me .
i say `` always , either , or no one .
so next sheet is also do with text .
's kind of a little <unk> .
i ' and then for the insects written .
very politely ?
yes , <unk> text .
is a little <unk> .
and it 's about cool , when i do that you three people might .
my text is the title , all good things are really cool .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> so dry .
<unk> we <unk> <unk> .
so to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and scratch , and then becomes the better and , it 's it .
more <unk> moment .
yes , <unk> <unk> , this is this time the other .
and it 's about cool whenever i 'm like , ' that we all this <unk> kind <unk> could do , so <unk> try and that every time .
right , so that what the wind power , wait .
the text is the title <unk> and goes down here .
yes .
's fun with you .
the <unk> text is just a sentence .
i write the way to little <unk> .
this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> about <unk> to this .
<unk> s ?
yes , yeah .
's fun with you .
yes , <unk> sentence .
this is in <unk> written .
is a very long sentence .
i find it almost impossible , <unk> in <unk> to explain this is the point .
here , a text .
this day is a <unk> .
is the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he does it .
he did it already know , before i it as such <unk> .
he was <unk> of the <unk> , then he 's me <unk> .
i could i later , in him <unk> .
i gave him the joy .
it as <unk> of all other day <unk> and i decided to sleep laid down .
with a <unk> <unk> the face where else ?
and purpose , it does n't even more to <unk> , i <unk> .
and i later , but back up , it 's not about a crappy day traded .
i hope , right ?
now it 's time for a joke .
and said albert einstein , as to be steak n't <unk> ?
i <unk> .
so .
letter <unk> sounds like the cow .
so it 's funny .
yes , the text , the paper 's learned .
is more what political .
so , i write `` it 's funny things .
i write `` well as part of political things .
and it 'll ' i often wondered , where i <unk> .
and , there was ' i just this text is written .
he carries the title <unk> .
my father came from vienna , in my mother and i made of her .
yes .
we would have the <unk> .
thank you for the noise .
yes , at this point <unk> ' i 'd like a bit of advertising .
and i can not <unk> or so that , so i have this is <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i also for events and i <unk> also for a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
can like to come .
and now , i <unk> , i <unk> ' actually very <unk> .
and , yeah .
it would ' i just have said .
it goes on the program .
more advertising .
this is a little advertising , i just wrote was .
feet .
realm of vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin <unk> .
it 's very funny .
i do on a joke about the <unk> your girlfriend write but the <unk> was just a flat .
yes , is not been my <unk> .
<unk> you <unk> to stop the <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk> to make the <unk> <unk> of it .
yes .
thank you for 's listening .
they were great .
thank you , and gentlemen .
let me the same with a <unk> question .
why do you <unk> actually do ?
i mean , anyone who 's taxpayer used to , whether it at least one potentially of society which give back .
the answer is very clear .
we know now that the life , at the birth to just to talk about <unk> percent of genetic <unk> .
this does it 's got any environmental issues , <unk> give the impact on <unk> .
why we know yet , so little ?
why are we bombarded by the <unk> messages from the <unk> that the part of each other <unk> ?
you remember , all of fifteen years ago was the <unk> found .
it was fat .
you thought , if you get out of food <unk> , we 're all <unk> and be healthy .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on with different <unk> in american <unk> led , and what do n't remember it has changed that the americans every year 's thicker become .
then you have said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the <unk> .
and then to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and led .
so it again and <unk> new <unk> the through the village <unk> .
where all the <unk> ?
now , the reason is , for my taste of the part at that we 're going through <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to scientific wisdom <unk> .
typical example of a <unk> <unk> is here .
the <unk> you know about all .
<unk> published a lot <unk> magazine a new <unk> .
the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for the <unk> year .
keith richards , seven years for the number one <unk> .
then of the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest man , the <unk> ever been on earth was living .
<unk> years old .
i know , there somewhere people to say , they 're six , but in their <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> .
and they listened to <unk> on the smoking started but with <unk> again , and then finally , <unk> <unk> the path of the virtue of the and stop the smoking .
with <unk> is then they died .
which tells us that ?
not that cigarettes healthy .
but it tells us that aging very complicated , and that we clean statistics do we need , experimental systems and we need to the simple questions .
<unk> very simple question and a very simple <unk> , in different countries <unk> is women are older than men .
what is that ?
we do now .
it 's on testosterone and <unk> so , what happened in the male <unk> produced .
and there 's <unk> very simple as evidence for <unk> men are just as old as women .
can now , for yourself think if that a <unk> <unk> .
austria 's a <unk> country .
but there are even better tips , not afraid .
in shall we hats correlation with <unk> to <unk> .
sounds complicated , but it 's easy to <unk> <unk> to illustrate .
and visited so somebody <unk> <unk> grandma , and asks , what you because it differently , or not eaten them to be so , and become are ?
ah .
the granny say , every day , cigarettes <unk> .
this is probably the secret of her age , right ?
they have the ten cigarettes , maybe just not <unk> .
or but they have <unk> and grandma , without the ten cigarettes even older .
even the statistics are not always <unk> .
there for example <unk> very hard , which shows that people that <unk> in the <unk> to get older , when people who do n't do .
<unk> .
is <unk> .
is that the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because that people just enough money in the bag have to be good for her age and the <unk> disorders of care .
if i but a group of <unk> a <unk> to feed me give and this group of 20 percent longer live as <unk> <unk> the <unk> you do n't get , but otherwise , the same thought was then i actually be a <unk> factor in the diet affected .
and actually are these attempts 've been .
have to tell that <unk> 's very <unk> thing but even though i with my enemies agree , is that <unk> <unk> the life <unk> .
and this works for the different organisms .
for example of bacteria .
you see here <unk> <unk> of bacteria .
if we <unk> , in the <unk> line showing you live in the very much longer .
the same is for <unk> , <unk> fly mice and recently was about two years in the united states that it even for the same .
it 's not about , skinny .
it 's also in <unk> the <unk> kitchen .
and that 's another experiment , what in the united states was done .
what did you do ?
you have <unk> <unk> , and the swami is this so-called <unk> <unk> , a <unk> diet , so many <unk> one day and night out .
and who <unk> it , mice , dick , sick and have <unk> very bad <unk> had and bad <unk> .
now , you <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that has the right in the same amount of <unk> fed just that <unk> <unk> break .
so , during n't eat allowed to do you have at twice as much eating .
and these <unk> now , <unk> and healthy and they also has no <unk> .
although they mice <unk> feeds .
both have a lot eaten .
and a sick and the other healthy .
what 's really ?
it 's a process called <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
whenever they organisms , cells to take it 's the organism , <unk> ingredients in the cell or <unk> ingredients <unk> to make it again energy .
that makes sense .
and it looks like this .
you can see , as in the really , <unk> , mainly , to <unk> , during the age <unk> .
the <unk> then with the <unk> the ingredients to <unk> and the cell as energy back at .
it will you damage that at the accumulate in the thought .
this is quite the molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> often .
so , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the lives in all these organisms .
and it 's likely to assume that this is also in people work .
and we learn from that they are you do n't like in <unk> recommended every little <unk> a day with 20 <unk> combat .
no .
but , they are supposed to say , if you 're hungry , ah , maybe it 's just the <unk> <unk> .
embrace it your hunger like a boyfriend .
and that 's also <unk> sense .
while <unk> point , nine percent of history has the person what did , when he hunger had ?
right , he 's hunt .
we go on the refrigerator hunting rights , if we 're hungry .
and that 's safe for the biology .
now we know , and that 's already in the bible , in <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is <unk> , but the meat is weak .
and paradise , for us very different from .
here , from <unk> <unk> in a medieval paradise shown .
the three <unk> here 's good , the food all the day , let 's also 're .
and that 's kind of the real <unk> .
we 've been so on the search for substances made the molecular answer the <unk> turn though the organism eat .
it would be able to be interesting , whose <unk> not enough just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it could we may be in front of the in <unk> of life preserve .
the question is so we can see the <unk> that <unk> , the cellular <unk> turn , although you eat ?
and we have many hundreds of the thousand substances <unk> , natural substances .
we have , in a found that means <unk> .
<unk> is a substance , in all these organisms <unk> is the but also in all these organisms during the <unk> less .
in your skin , it 's the <unk> .
<unk> people have been much less <unk> in your skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells , for example , then you see here .
this is <unk> <unk> cell .
is the <unk> , the <unk> we give <unk> on and we see many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell , the <unk> , during the age <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells would be exactly like this .
and this works in all these organisms .
here , shown on a <unk> .
so we have <unk> substance of the molecular <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
life because the organisms that even more .
and the answer is again , you see here <unk> typical <unk> of a <unk> .
there are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days are all dead , <unk> days is about half the dead .
whenever we <unk> the water , here in <unk> be the animals grow and survive better .
we also know that human cells that we of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have in culture about three times as long survive , if we 're going to <unk> shoes .
and the latest research , too close to start to the lives of all over mice , <unk> <unk> .
and is not just the life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are very <unk> .
so .
now you want of all know , where does <unk> before ?
how the name it says , it 's the sperm discovered , because it in very high <unk> ago .
but i can you <unk> , even in <unk> <unk> green pepper mushrooms cheese , and a product of <unk> <unk> , what in japan , <unk> <unk> , this is so <unk> <unk> 's very much <unk> ago .
so we then , if <unk> against <unk> help , by the <unk> <unk> does it may also to <unk> ?
you do you know that the common denominator of all <unk> -- is that during the age <unk> the brain <unk> .
and we have , in experiments to be done .
they will be wondering , we have the edge of flies .
flies , which is also <unk> , if you 're old .
they have more <unk> the brain , if you 're old .
and the molecular mechanisms that for memory of these are very much like the people .
now you 're still , like the has the guy that memory of fruit measured ?
this is the experiment , what we share with stefan <unk> of the university berlin .
they take a fruit and <unk> the here to give them a <unk> that you love .
<unk> .
and let that in this <unk> <unk> .
then you take the fly , give them in the chamber , and give them <unk> other <unk> that you love , which is <unk> .
we now , the <unk> enjoy , while they but <unk> <unk> <unk> .
classical <unk> .
then you take over the fly , do this one in .
they 're here degrees in the <unk> down , because you see the .
and if it down here get there are going to give them from the one <unk> and from other side <unk> to .
where they 're going to all go ?
right .
the <unk> .
except the two here .
these are the <unk> .
or , say , they have character .
i love my <unk> and i do ' i 'm not by this <unk> <unk> reward <unk> .
okay .
but it 's <unk> form of <unk> , working with the age <unk> .
not just to fly .
and we could actually the <unk> the fly through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , at once again .
and the <unk> that the brain did was , again mined .
so , <unk> does n't just to <unk> , but for <unk> diseases , perhaps .
and that 's important , because we want to do the <unk> not the <unk> by se <unk> .
it does n't make sense , the time the <unk> to <unk> .
and i want you 're not by , without them and again a few practical tips to give us we have younger .
and again <unk> <unk> .
it 's not that you lose weight on or so .
there are actually come in austria <unk> group of <unk> people who have a day to eat and a day n't eat .
this is this so-called <unk> the line of <unk> <unk> and erwin <unk> .
and keep the very good .
so , it 's <unk> .
avoid it <unk> .
it 's not about <unk> complex <unk> do not harmful .
it 's really care of candy .
you know now that <unk> <unk> are to get diabetes <unk> , even then if you <unk> .
and you know that sugar the growth of tumors speed .
now you <unk> <unk> that are going on the <unk> .
after 30 days are all dead .
very low really of glucose rich .
for a <unk> effect .
there 's just an example , it works in almost all these organisms that .
eat them on fruits and vegetables .
avoid the gift of too much <unk> or from <unk> at all .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer in .
it 's not under a lot of vitamin d .
we are there might have degrees ' in a <unk> , because vitamin d is going through the sunlight on the skin and formed .
some you look at least three times per week <unk> half hour in sports , this is trivial .
cigarettes , despite the <unk> <unk> examples of them <unk> 10 to fifteen years lifetime .
do you look at times the eternal <unk> occasionally the quiet .
the impact of pray and blood pressure on the life is <unk> .
because monks in almost as long , how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> are still no longer than <unk> .
just <unk> , sooner than <unk> .
what is that ?
so people think that has about what <unk> substances .
no way , no way that 's very simple .
so now here 's <unk> the window , then <unk> ' i do with <unk> <unk> solution .
and what that 's probably in your <unk> .
<unk> scaling , <unk> and so what , and alcohol , in there <unk> .
so , alcohol , <unk> <unk> effect .
one of partners , or <unk> family is to have associated with .
you should n't look at a lot <unk> the housing .
now you think about <unk> .
so , but with <unk> nothing to do .
it 's about <unk> .
you can measure the closer to a lot <unk> the lives , more <unk> he 's the blood .
and also , when he says , i was <unk> were used .
i can pretty good to sleep and the noise that makes me nothing like .
's not true .
he 's still more <unk> the blood and that 's bad .
are supposed to <unk> , because <unk> course .
we know now that <unk> very good metabolic effects .
and mostly it can see the <unk> down .
and we also know that <unk> and <unk> mice , <unk> protect .
it did , by our grandmothers have been the us with <unk> and so <unk> .
may not without any sense .
several of <unk> that dark chocolate , dementia <unk> work .
just recently is a study <unk> that have shown that <unk> half the dark chocolate a day the <unk> one <unk> on the level of <unk> bring it .
that <unk> one of coffee is the <unk> but thinner .
there are many studies that show , there are many studies that does n't show .
what it is that coffee , diabetes <unk> does and their metabolic performance better .
and coffee is actually also a good <unk> because he solves <unk> , like we share with <unk> <unk> of paris to show .
<unk> very nice and intricate study in a thousand people fifteen years for research , have shown that people that every day <unk> handful <unk> eat their <unk> about 20 percent down .
this is a massive value for <unk> <unk> study .
and that with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not for peanuts the <unk> seen in beans .
they 're just , showing you <unk> call , okay ?
so , but actually beans .
so for peanuts is n't it .
so the point is a little <unk> .
avoid the shot of thousands of animal protein , so of meat and dairy , but only if you between <unk> and <unk> years old .
<unk> very nice to study suggests that you , if you in this <unk> of animal protein to be able to take you <unk> so strong increase , as if you 're a strong <unk> .
it 's not for the time after the animal protein well , and it 's of course not for <unk> children or teenagers , the animal protein need and it 's not for pregnant and that there are .
in avoid it <unk> .
so , they do , keep them <unk> that had been , nietzsche that said , <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> mistrust and <unk> are signs of health .
everything <unk> heard in the pathology .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> who has about after this regime , and he 's <unk> years old .
he comes from my home <unk> from the <unk> that 's never get sick .
and it 's very good .
he 's just not <unk> <unk> no anecdote , but he lives in a <unk> , where it in a healthy <unk> there .
he 's about the <unk> followed that i want to say .
we should look at all the <unk> experiments <unk> important fact , not there are missing .
which is that the <unk> of <unk> me in a biological but a social to be , and then a <unk> .
you <unk> the people less , and it could one of <unk> mistake of our culture .
<unk> wrote the novel , the <unk> a year before his death .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece that contemporary critics of all the adolescent fresh <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i want them .
a question , where we do n't get up to , because it 's a little <unk> out of you are lonely ?
the <unk> 's very low .
one more than i thought .
it 's probably the reasons why you 're not reported that have also the people that , which is quite <unk> .
many people <unk> <unk> and loneliness and think that would <unk> .
and it 's not at the case .
'll see loneliness is actually more like a phenomenon of people as alone .
maybe it also that you 're not reported , because the question fuzzy put it .
feel you lonely , or is one lonely ?
and you are lonely feel , without lonely .
and you can lonely be without looking at the moment lonely to feel .
loneliness also has a shame .
and it 's some now here <unk> , to loneliness to <unk> .
loneliness leads to shame and shame , and loneliness .
loneliness takes time .
it is why is now here they reported have in the few seconds , which i gave me .
loneliness to <unk> .
loneliness to the time to their even aware .
and loneliness need to exercise to talk about .
and this exercise have we <unk> n't .
we have neither the language , we sign of ourselves to see when we are lonely ?
there 's the loneliness two <unk> , which i again and <unk> am .
the one part of humanity , it 's the beginning of lonely .
from the birth to the death is you actually just lonely .
there 's a few moments in life where you <unk> .
these people go and often to <unk> and <unk> to all day .
i `` no time , is so you <unk> .
and then there are people might be less <unk> to say , everything is with everything connected .
so let 's actually do n't know , so , let 's just a part of the big universe .
and there 's the great group , and i also belong to the time so , so thinking .
i think , okay , today i 'm a lonely and the next day , oh , it depends on but all together .
if we thought of loneliness to think it 's always the first of the very large loneliness to a .
and loneliness of <unk> , and loneliness the <unk> on a intensive care .
but about these <unk> , about these big <unk> <unk> ' i did n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , about the mundane <unk> , where loneliness to be in such a theater to face .
i want to do n't talk about the burden and <unk> of <unk> .
loneliness to others to it 's mostly not hard loneliness to us to <unk> already .
the photographer christine tailors , in the break a few pictures taken that i show you want .
how easy it 's always , in other loneliness to .
and we know all do n't know , whether these people are really right now there lonely felt .
but who does n't it , the moment in this <unk> event , where you think , all talk to each other , just to itself is lost something in the corner and did n't want to <unk> .
and suddenly <unk> loneliness are safe here .
may have some of you today is also have experienced .
so what you about it does it is the mobile out very often , that could you today is very good at this is <unk> that <unk> on the phone to escape from the <unk> .
very visible , if you on the display look .
what we 're not do .
yes , and then there and loneliness that have been in front of them , and loneliness to a <unk> on <unk> stage with hundreds of <unk> faces a and you even something out in the hope that you have to text n't <unk> .
these are the <unk> that you from outside .
and other people <unk> .
but i 'm sure , there 's also people in the room , from birth of lonely feel that all their entire life as <unk> , is they tried , and loneliness to be <unk> to distract .
and there are in this room guaranteed to people who are lonely , because you on a different people <unk> must be there because of death , because of separation .
there to use it 's nothing that 's so many people , people to you 're connected , around you are they are feeling lonely .
and there are people who have the to yourself in do n't touch with more to , and are so lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and sit on her in the <unk> loneliness .
the <unk> loneliness is to trust .
these are people have to her , it <unk> of social contacts .
also that 's always sort .
there 's not an official number , no <unk> number , when someone to human contact , when did n't .
we fall and immediately the old people .
it 's the <unk> form of loneliness .
since we all in cities live connected with very many people at facebook or , twitter or facebook is this digital loneliness bigger and .
you can do with hundreds of people to be , with a single person gets really connected .
it 's the <unk> loneliness to the <unk> of human relationships , the missing is it at the digital loneliness the quality of the connection .
the two forms of loneliness to be very much each other <unk> .
it 's also that the <unk> loneliness a little <unk> <unk> .
whereas the digital loneliness to really good works for <unk> and <unk> in <unk> .
it 's kind of them go to the digital loneliness in the future to gain , if the ways that to connect to get bigger .
i do n't know , whether you in 20 years that feeling that the our from loneliness very similar to be , and loneliness to call .
or whether you and then a new word is .
but that are also kind of the problems of <unk> generation .
almost more than the loneliness itself is the fear of the loneliness and from this fear of the loneliness 's people much to do ready .
<unk> , the great <unk> , a <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in that describes her , what people do anything to not alone .
they build one of , they witnesses kids who then again lonely , and alone .

<unk> go .
things to acquire .
both the process <unk> , and loneliness , because it at <unk> a touch with makes and the objects themselves that you <unk> .
problem is just that it 's very quickly help and holding , that this <unk> against the loneliness .
so we have again and new things get us to <unk> .
i ' time the advertisement for a a <unk> panties label .
and the <unk> really quite a <unk> of your communications with the slogan be <unk> of it .
what that the panties to do , do you do n't know , but apparently works , that .
loneliness that 's nothing to the <unk> to do loneliness is among people that takes place .
<unk> <unk> has a wonderful poem written , and there is a verse but the worst is the loneliness to <unk> .
hand on the heart , who knows that ?
in a relationship <unk> or the or the other , <unk> to see , all of a terrible just to feel that awful lonely to feel and the question to ask , who is this person in ?
i ' i 'm going to do something to do ?
a study is that the <unk> women around the fifty years , married , with kids , feel .
demonstration missing , because i have been no longer know , if i the study of self was invented , so often have ' i told .
but it 's also a matter because it at these studies the matter , and the response to think about is that people to me <unk> .
that it is intuitively , all of course , almost a <unk> .
loneliness to <unk> is any <unk> and let 's not about them .
talk that little bit about the loneliness to sex .
and it 's probably already all experienced .
even when you <unk> is a sudden to think , what do ' i really ?
who is that person in my bed in ?
the a form of loneliness to do n't exactly what to do have to the quality of sexual <unk> .
it 's nothing to do have to the quality of relationship .
it 's just always there .
we 're just not about it because we do n't look .
we 're talking about it 's not about you the workforce .
the workforce , and loneliness to <unk> when we think .
i stood <unk> on this <unk> <unk> and i 've seen a group of five <unk> , better , three carrying suit , and two carrying <unk> .
the two men have to talk , the two women in <unk> have to talk .
and the state something <unk> , a little <unk> with the <unk> in my hand of <unk> .
i <unk> , i have to the scene n't go out and this form of loneliness that everyone 's also have time in the workforce experienced , again <unk> .
it 's the and loneliness of <unk> .
so , but also the loneliness of <unk> .
we 've all the <unk> or i see , here you may also some of their lives <unk> to <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> into hotels , in <unk> <unk> who often do n't know more , who they actually , what they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
also that 's a form of loneliness that not talking .
just so it 's also <unk> , and loneliness than <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> .
i have a <unk> told that he called was a clients , and he said , it 's what 's <unk> happens , you can you do n't imagine .
a <unk> was in the <unk> .
so it yourself for <unk> <unk> .
and two months later , he also <unk> .
and loneliness is not just so .
it 's always in the connection with other feelings .
she 's nice siblings and she 's ugly siblings .
the ugly siblings , we all .
fear of sadness despair anger and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful siblings not forget .
the freedom to be a yearning that <unk> .
so my <unk> look at the loneliness .
come and goes in life as <unk> and tide .
let them , and let 's not from her , .
because there 's something much worse than the loneliness and this is the emptiness that perhaps , and loneliness is when you do n't it feels .
loneliness is part of life .
since i was so hard about loneliness thought i have to me two things .
for one in my <unk> the <unk> i no more like a <unk> dictator since i realized was that i 'm only then , who called , why he 's not <unk> because i thought , maybe <unk> i the people , i 'm ' i lonely .
it 's been able to , since i and loneliness in my life is , people come and go .
so it 's the <unk> that you see that does .
and there i free .
people come and go , they 're not be right to <unk> , whether it from an encounter a friendship , or at a partnership up .
as a child , i found my parents of embarrassing .
they can look at any <unk> <unk> without to a conversation begin .
whether it in the <unk> or in the economy .
every time , it to <unk> talking about .
as a child , i found that as i embarrassed .
as a grownup i did you just for <unk> this to do this openness .
but first ever since i myself , and loneliness actually have to get it was at and again , also <unk> to open .
you see the lonely , is to be willing to make for the performance .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i ' and three <unk> here .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and ask , and they 're just have access <unk> which <unk> would you take ?
and most people would look for the <unk> .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we do with the <unk> effort the effect get .
in health do we kind of different .
so let 's the activity of the effect completely different than eight and make us for some strategies .
we make us for example of the <unk> and it stands for sports .
big <unk> but big effort .
for me that 's not so valuable .
or we make us to <unk> .
it stands for food .
also very big <unk> but still very big effort .
for me that 's also not so valuable .
and i want to tell you with the <unk> effort the <unk> get .
if you look at prevention and health busy , you to an issue of the drum around .
and the point is overweight .
and the subject overweight was in germany long time , no issue , so it up in the <unk> .
and then went from the number <unk> in germany , .
and i asked me , what it was going to <unk> ?
why did this so <unk> suddenly the top ?
and then i research and i 'm also <unk> .
because it was just in <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> in germany .
and we 're over and thicker ?
and i kept <unk> .
<unk> comes <unk> in germany .
and the overweight up .
and in <unk> take the curve , the right to take on .
and what happens then in germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how it means .
and we 're over and thicker ?
well , then i was one and one <unk> .
because it was , right .
sports , thick .
and of <unk> ' i 'm not here , to tell you that sports thick .
because that 's not .
but one , we now have found .
the flood of the new <unk> -- and <unk> did n't want to be made that we <unk> and healthier .
what it 's so then ?
the food ?
and there 's <unk> very wonderful study from the united states .
the have the problem with overweight .
and they have in the <unk> <unk> introduced .
and then they shortly after watching , what happens is really ?
and they 've seen that people take in fact , less fat on the people take , fewer calories to be but nevertheless , thicker .
and this was paradox .
and so you have it <unk> called .
we can you do ?
you can you look at the body as a power station .
because we have been so <unk> big <unk> .
and on the one is a <unk> , there are we all the <unk> on that might be here burned .
and here 's the energy <unk> like electricity .
if we now , more <unk> here in giving in our power than we on the other use <unk> the energy in power and it makes <unk> .
the human body does n't matter <unk> .
this is the energy store .
and it in fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happens , if we 're not as we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> , and the energy and it just one end up .
the <unk> has to drastically reduces .
here is what do n't live longer .
we 're right to mobile .
and that 's happening .
our grandparents are <unk> , 20 kilometers to get did .
and we are today has been used to be on one to two miles and they 're the positive estimates .
there are trials , the reports of five -- until <unk> feet .
i <unk> ' you the another thing <unk> with my friend mike tell .
give you want to me degrees ' the chair ?
mike , come you degrees ' time ?
mike 's an american .
he 's too shy , he 's not much .
and he was at this study , and is now here .
he 's this typical <unk> <unk> , jeans <unk> <unk> and he has a <unk> in my hand .
and mike eat less and and fewer and takes to <unk> , and yet he 's over and thicker .
why ?
because mike just sitting .
and i said , <unk> , how much of mike 's a day , and got him , such a <unk> back into the bag into and at night i decided to <unk> .
and stood on a thousand steps .
it was so the distance that mike <unk> has in the <unk> the car with the car in the office there , of a bit of coffee go and the back .
and he came up a thousand steps .
so , mike was that day 10 minutes on his legs .
<unk> hours and fifty minutes was mike , or was mike .
of these conditions of disease of alone .
and mike 's not so therefore fat , because he too much eating because that long time it up again and energy <unk> , but not used to he necessarily always thicker , and the energy <unk> .
and first <unk> the energy , as you see here to <unk> .
but energy is <unk> , which is n't there .
the <unk> look at some back in <unk> blood .
and also because it 's active and <unk> silent and little bit of his <unk> .
so the <unk> .
so if the energy <unk> the blood , then they 're talking about the doctors of high <unk> and high <unk> .
and this <unk> , the <unk> and how <unk> that makes all over the little black holes in this <unk> .
and a very floating around the whole get around and that <unk> , well over these little wounds and we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
and this is <unk> heart right under pressure , because now , he the blood of these tight <unk> <unk> pumps and we talk from high blood .
and if this high blood then on such a <unk> hits , then makes it also in the body <unk> .
and when the heart , then we call the heart attack .
and if that the head happens then we call the stroke .
and also in germany dying every second of heart attack , stroke .
so , in germany dying every second thing about <unk> .
and mike gets so not so sick because he 's not a sports drives but because he 's not anymore .
and if you have these <unk> n't know , looking for you always on the wrong spot .
so for the theme of diet .
i have degrees ' i have a diet on the amazon <unk> and there are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , out .
and if each book just as a few inches thick , and we 'd like this one <unk> , we would have a 30 feet high tower recent <unk> <unk> .
and i the time for them all read .
and there 's inside and now this is really matter if you more energy be so more food as they are then they get fat .
and if you spend less energy pick up as they are then you will thin .
it 's brilliant .
but why we need to <unk> books .
this is just one end up .
the need is , huge but <unk> is to do n't help .
because why <unk> a diet of a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet , and not a lifestyle .
what to the things that we 're going to three weeks , and here 's five weeks ago when we then , after this struggle , again in the normal life back , to our normal lifestyle .
what is then actually , after five or seven weeks ago ?
nothing .
except <unk> and again a <unk> the confidence that we decided to do n't do that , what we <unk> .
so we want you off now with any new diet , with any new <unk> questions , and they want it in their life , in your lifestyle more .
yes or no ?
and if we then <unk> .
and if no , let 's just stay .
because when the end it out , it 's pure <unk> .
it 's the habits , to decide whether we 're sick , or a healthy .
there are the bad habits that 's get sick .
and it 's the good habits of us healthy .
and mike in the mirror look and then he 's the result of everyday <unk> .
and mike in the mirror look , and then he 's your everyday habits .
and mike in the mirror look and frankly , it is , and then he also , where it on .
because when he more bad habits as good , then it 's just towards the disease on .
and mike in the way to the health direction of its goals , moving your dreams , then , he did n't immediately his whole life <unk> .
then , he just more good habits as bad .
and a <unk> habits mike 's also a great example of the human being a weird animal is .
mike , it for example been able to explore motion , from his life <unk> and every way to the car that drives a <unk> uses , every <unk> use .
and night , he <unk> on the up and to somehow <unk> back to movement .
so is it in his <unk> goes into <unk> there with the <unk> looking at what yes , se the paradox is and will then as <unk> is back on such a band <unk> , so he got back to movement .
and my grandpa would be just as <unk> as you .
it was <unk> and the could do n't understand .
it would have said , sports , for people who are not move .
and somehow he 's also be right .
why we have one in our <unk> like to the <unk> what we in life <unk> have ?
strictly taken to us today with this <unk> lifestyle two hours of sports make a day .
and about very much easier to the movement , there to find where we 're lost .
in life .
and so <unk> ' i want you today to a perspective like .
maybe you know , and the situation , you drive night and again , the shop and <unk> out that in the first of a room for free .
and you see how that has this <unk> in us .
we want to the shortest because they go .
we do our homes that we <unk> ways .
we do our whole life so that we <unk> ways , but that leads us but not going to where we <unk> .
but in a very different way .
so we 're going down to the <unk> activate and the movement , there , where they 've been up .
i <unk> ' like to the <unk> .
and i 'm the only that 's still up and down and up and down in and everybody else .
but if i , but we 've ever since i then <unk> ' i but the time for me .
then <unk> ' i but the movement , that 's just so around .
and when the top of the <unk> , 30 minutes <unk> , say `` i <unk> .
<unk> steps .
that 's about three times 10 minutes , translated into .
and a <unk> <unk> steps if you off with every day <unk> steps to go and that means that they are the end of the day 12 grams fat not in your body <unk> .
this may be relatively little bit of sound .
but when <unk> , as a established , <unk> days in the year , let 's talk about four point five of fat .
we can not in your body .
and you give me degrees ' time that , i <unk> ' it always <unk> .
the americans are so crazy , who are so what here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
are <unk> ' i four pounds .
just so you see , what 's what happens with these little steps .
and if that the effect is about this perspective , what do you know , what it happens , if you really in an active life to start .
and these <unk> to bring you look down to every day in their life .
once you look at <unk> steps per day to get there are going to run it almost all <unk> of them .
and if you like and time , in sports and then you make it on top .
then you have to the <unk> , <unk> .
then you will be even faster and more .
but lest you make your health no more on the sport .
so you make your health no more on of like and from their time .
because the most the most do that , every day as a lifestyle .
and i <unk> ' an active lifestyle <unk> .
and for me , it 's become more than a lifestyle , for me it 's a <unk> it on a clear that 's for the life and for myself .
because i think , health has n't want to do , what we should do n't do have .
but health has to do , what we want to do .
and so <unk> ' i just have an idea for them .
you decide to start off now just sitting still for the best .
and off now you know , how it .
step back to step .
thank you .
<unk> how it has a leonardo , da vinci , actually managed to this incredible , <unk> kind and in the world with others have to see ?
and yourself as far the <unk> , what to his time just simply <unk> , almost unimaginable was ?
we could sort of today , ok ?
the maybe about what <unk> to do ?
and how can we force and <unk> for our future <unk> ?
let 's a then on the question what do we kind of innovation ?
right .
the invention of research and development in the official <unk> the federal government has the title <unk> the federal government .
so you know , right .
it 's all great .
and we can with quite proud to be and be grateful that we <unk> in such a fields are that our <unk> all over the needed to that it 's good to go .
we 're making a this extraordinary , unique wealth developed .
but what about the future , like ?
the challenges , because as a society based on us to ?
and who cares , because the big ecological and social challenges ?
so <unk> ' it somehow <unk> .
a kind of <unk> .
so the economy care of the ecological challenges because the entrepreneurs , big effort to the we then productivity and efficiency up .
and the world better do want to find a nonprofit organization and , and <unk> and the need to then also what do so the main <unk> of course , and then the damage the capitalist economy to 're .
at <unk> to fix .
but who says , because that we all this as well , separated at need ?
how about it because if we <unk> to <unk> social and cultural dimension , ?
and technological innovation at the cultural innovation ?
and economic development of at the social innovation ?
when we <unk> <unk> thinking and doing sent <unk> with the solution , <unk> and social challenges ?
if it very different the unknown forces <unk> and when we <unk> a very different , <unk> <unk> development promote ?
because it was that ?
both sides to but what companies , right ?
can it a ?
you might be deal .
so we have that yes , as a contradiction <unk> .
fortunately , are <unk> examples .
muhammad yunus , with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh creepy much <unk> the poverty and <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more just in direct <unk> to what the federal <unk> done .
and he did <unk> as an entrepreneur , i 've all the nobel peace <unk> .
the opportunity to go into a i <unk> ' they still with anyone familiar .
<unk> , can i think <unk> <unk> .
<unk> very <unk> a guy .
super trained , but also the ideal from .
and yes , so , <unk> .
i like the really like .
and if you see , think it 's really , the offspring , because we need to us about our future do n't worry .
yes , right after the studying , he then there somewhere in this starting to work in our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it 's he also very good .
it like him , and there 's also very successful .
and yet anything , there 's in him .
so he says , there 's not even more than that somehow , i have ?
so that the entrepreneurial he says , whatever .
<unk> are , in all <unk> .
and enjoy it also .
and he had fallen in this <unk> .
so the right there 's the <unk> that it is equal recognized .
so not that he asked him for me know , but as the <unk> says he 's already know what .
and in the middle of the t three to the knew he did n't .
so even more than he was surprised when the back then the <unk> personally imagined .
when mister <unk> .
and when <unk> experienced entrepreneur , he , and imagined .
that 's great <unk> , so with these young people together , and his his experience <unk> .
and the two , you know there 's found .
and have always <unk> met .
how about it because if we just like in a lot of talking about the two times <unk> ?
yes mister <unk> , so how it was because , right .
what 's exactly the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> company ?
i did n't like to understand .
yes , so , <unk> then let 's a lot of the question what 's <unk> <unk> company ?
so name says it 's already .
were markets , were products , were clients who were structures , there 's a <unk> .
and you can also quite the predictions off , where the great things <unk> .
and time <unk> <unk> <unk> , even if it 's all is , it off .
what 's because then actually a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you <unk> been so one is a guaranteed to do it 's not the small copy of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it 's a completely different character .
because it , nothing <unk> .
no <unk> customers , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
of this is a <unk> a temporary organization that the purpose is a business to go to find , to develop the profitable is , of that , but most of all <unk> , and then scale .
and you 're going to ensure that it course , so <unk> a very different very different <unk> , very different <unk> , very different ways .
, it 's me , right .
but after what do we because it ?
so , i <unk> ' time , then we go , there drum more <unk> <unk> to make money ?
so i said , there 's degree , it fits very well , so <unk> seminar found in berlin would you know that would recommend ?
so , <unk> .
how you are successful <unk> and after the <unk> your entire life <unk> did .
oh no .
so <unk> ?
what do you because if you with the 30 your <unk> money did what 's because after that your <unk> ?
so <unk> you then a career as <unk> <unk> or what ?
what happens then with your commitment , as i see you know ?
and let 's a the <unk> .
so the statistics about <unk> give you do n't <unk> perspective , because seventy percent of <unk> are few years , and in a lot <unk> financial situation in front of her big go .
it 's always the result of a successful company and a good <unk> company .
now , money is a <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
and the basis of economic <unk> .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , which is then the target ?
the company ?
so , when i 'm going to find ' i said , but we learned , so without the goal is no way the right .
and so , aims to do n't always <unk> measurable <unk> to be .
and if i it 's not have , so this as i can make a search of that i did n't know what i go to ?
so that makes me n't feel good .
so how do i because there to decide , and taking into that 's going to me all the vague , and <unk> .
yes , <unk> welcome the <unk> .
but i ' and maybe what for you .
a thread .
so that 's been <unk> , almost a secret .
successful <unk> by generation of every generation <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , or as you today ?
<unk> <unk> ' i , <unk> ?
so we say , always <unk> to .
in <unk> crises and <unk> and <unk> sustainable uncertainty .
so it helps guaranteed .
i <unk> ' , i can you one of left .
okay .
yes , thanks , mister <unk> .
but there are , just ask it .
it can you through the same time when one of the major <unk> qualities that 's good question to imagine .
we can see the time one after the other through that i want to be better understand ?
so the first is what i 'm here and what i want to do ?
yes , <unk> , there 's <unk> what you know what about you , beyond that it 's when you yourself ?
what <unk> you the world ?
what have the people of them , if you to work ?
what you 're willing to be ?
what are your inner , maybe we also become unconscious <unk> ?
why is that important that to see ?
because these are also your <unk> <unk> .
and how we have this from learning ?
if you a ship to do then <unk> not the guys all parts of a name of wood to collect to teach them , yearning for the in , <unk> sea .
yes , well .
so then look so let me the next question .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
which means that ?

<unk> <unk> in detail , <unk> but i <unk> ' you 'll be a if you <unk> what you do n't want to then it 's going to you hang .
<unk> you actually the story with the pink them ?
it was there is a .
not ?
<unk> .
so , pass time .
<unk> you have n't have a pink elephants .
okay ?
does it 's going ?
so no pink elephant .
that ?
not a pink elephant .
see you ?
so we go to us , when we 're so on focus on this is what we do n't want .
what is there in the only way ?
there about it <unk> ?
yes , right , <unk> ' you that , what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or perhaps the <unk> on the <unk> .
but <unk> 's going <unk> ago .
and what to me in mind you like but <unk> right ?
i said , you , there was brought .
look , if you the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> lord smith .
who ?
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i know what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i know what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> lady smith .
oh , but ♫ but <unk> <unk> you <unk> ?
<unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you one <unk> not do <unk> <unk> may is <unk> .
<unk> ago <unk> .
it 's <unk> a <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> you ?
and <unk> what 's like ?
is you , which noticed ?
's something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower .
okay .
so , let 's a then let 's where the bear remained .
and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> lord smith .
who ?
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i know what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i know what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> lady smith .
and <unk> , what 's telling you ?
so , i know , i was also be shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i the first time 've got .
i thought it can you probably not was .
and even more shocked i was like me through the head left is it could be that i 'm actually all the way through the area , over ?
through my life .
and look , i do this is yes , meaning .
to come up there the immediate <unk> to prevent that we most of our perception and our <unk> first <unk> .
but what 's because now in fact that ?
what <unk> ' i was and what <unk> ' i like ?
and so <unk> , <unk> you through your perception <unk> somewhere <unk> , is <unk> more important entrepreneurial quality .
well , thanks , then we get a to the next question .
how could i actually to my goal come ?
so , that i find <unk> good question .
and ask , let me because every time , and do somehow not going forward .
yes , <unk> , there 's <unk> good news for you .
it 's going to easier to fall when you might have been known did .
because if you through your <unk> realize is , your inner drive and if you <unk> <unk> will be very <unk> to do i promise you , it 's going to go inside of just happen .
almost automatically .
you 're not unlike able to be a <unk> in going on that things on you <unk> .
so , then this famous <unk> that you get the shower did .
and yet <unk> question recommend i 'm going to you look for you very well , if you <unk> could if you 're talking about some questions could to go to input , looking at home .
and you 've also a model .
the <unk> have the great <unk> .
<unk> di <unk> when the no longer to know , the in his <unk> invited in florence .
for lunch at the famous big table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , bankers , traders engineers , architect and he did <unk> very intense <unk> clean .
but not in our present senses , where the drum , yeah , who 's going through ?
who 's right ?
but rather to that all of these different <unk> things from the so on any kind and in one of them alone could have to come up .
well , the next question is the concrete next step i do ?
<unk> there to make it 's successful entrepreneur in the very simple .
instead of the planning and management and so on it 's just sitting on the next step .
because what do you in terms of uncertainty , do ?
but the lead to really determined and with the consequence .
and if it then there was well , dan do you hold <unk> one step .
and even if the big , <unk> <unk> <unk> nothing was then there 's hold <unk> other .
so it 's so important that you through your what is clear .
this gives you through the inside of security .
and the rest of how we actually all have learned ?
although we do n't know , and it 's no way ?
<unk> tells you also <unk> for children .
so , this <unk> to figure this is that <unk> <unk> searching it 's also , the fun doing that in a company is in a <unk> .
and that 's also just sort of the <unk> against the uncertainty , we would always been so <unk> .
yes , thank mister <unk> .
so this sounds , yes , very nice .
but i do n't so , at me in the company , i <unk> ' there have to have a lot of bosses change that there something happened .
and for reasons here in germany , there 's always like this is mood .
and i <unk> , there 'd have the politicians first to worry that this is changing .
okay my boy , come time with .
how do here 's down to the water .
what do you , how many people can you can change ?
10 ?
<unk> ?
ten million ?
look at this down .
who see you ?
right , the .
this is that you can change can that you really change can .
or so by mahatma <unk> to say for the change that you in the world <unk> in your own .
do you make beautiful words and the role models , but how do this because basically work ?
because we fortunately , even <unk> few <unk> on our <unk> .
helpful in all <unk> of crisis , or if you too small feel for something or if you a <unk> <unk> and they have with you to do .
and if you to sort of these situations ask what <unk> you now , despite all of ask , you , which posture you take can physically for yourself powerful to feel .
ask , you a , what you going to <unk> like , the you just <unk> .
and very , to ask , you what you 're actually from this crisis , which is bad happened is because you .
so i , if we 've already happening is that 's at <unk> .
yes .
mister <unk> thank you .
and do you really want to me that 's going on my <unk> way ?
well , right .
and <unk> out of two things .
first time <unk> on the clarity of your inner <unk> that then to your <unk> what will .
because it determines your perception .
and the second <unk> on your inner attitude to myself to .
because it <unk> you like the other people are going to behave .
the future of the only then when we have our perception .
<unk> you this ?
now , i think , already .
thank mister <unk> well then .
all good <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what you of our <unk> ?
nice .
indeed , or <unk> ?
and how do it 's because now , with this <unk> ?
it 's a new <unk> ?
i mean , yeah .
very clear .
what i of all the <unk> see .
<unk> is <unk> <unk> .
and that is , what the <unk> really like .
a <unk> from <unk> the <unk> .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
it 's the <unk> .
the right <unk> 've been in the big famous name <unk> .
from robert bosch , <unk> <unk> <unk> zeppelin or <unk> or how they 're called .
let 's very easy to mind to animate .
and who knows what is yes out of our <unk> the next leonardo our time .
they 're right , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it would be so <unk> that i with kids and their future <unk> because finally , yes , to our future .
instead is that the view that i of the time <unk> .
i spend a large part of my life in prison .
four years ago , my father and i the program <unk> , entrepreneurship for prisoners , started .
we <unk> <unk> <unk> , which means you can after the <unk> either their own , or find out of <unk> easier to work that you also hold .
why <unk> i so now how to <unk> , so those who have failed are the big mistake did ?
our program is far not as easy to understand how programs that for children .
and it had said i thought that the <unk> the place in the universe is , where i work .
what do you is the most of factor in childhood with the people with whom we work ?
what we 've , there are positive plenty often 's positive models .
and if you think about , why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> are often it 's that the father 's no sensible work has to him drink that he drugs food or that he himself in prison is .
and then a <unk> young think about what he comes from his life make me make it may not better idea , as a different lives to look , because he 's no better models .
and he <unk> his father .
i <unk> ' , martin .
martin 's <unk> our program .
his father was <unk> and made the whole family life the hell .
when he have been 's his mother died and he and be a brother had to home .
and he was the <unk> of the great .
he was shy , and <unk> and the perfect victims .
to the day as being a brother in a <unk> so roughly <unk> been doing is that the ground , it stayed .
there <unk> , martin the first time the <unk> through , he went on the enemy , and proposed to .
and from that day , it respects .
and so it was wrong .
violence and matched by now , to his life just like in his father .
how it 's going to those that i just described got to go ?
and as the youth who are many unemployed or have <unk> .
they 're not a different than your illegal activities and their <unk> <unk> .
and then they get one day with people in jail locked where it that goes , their thoughts about the same thing around the also not a better models are .
about what happens to do you think these people together , if you put together in prison you ?
mostly about not much good .
and they 're getting better criminals are in the <unk> .
they sell then drugs on a higher level and they 're still in the <unk> , after the <unk> <unk> .
and this is then in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
so , in germany , everybody <unk> second criminals <unk> .
then there but also people in prison , really change want .
but also the people have a <unk> on the forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere , where they come , is their first identity .
if you to work for , if you an apartment for me if you a private relationships that want to get them with that identity , with this <unk> face , you a <unk> in the society as an infinite hard power .
this is the problem , which we are .
how we try to this problem to solve ?
the quality , do you get a lot <unk> with ?
they will be surprised .
there are more entrepreneurial skills .
who have a <unk> built it 's definitely no idea of <unk> , from <unk> and from <unk> .

these features we would like a positive .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , in three <unk> .
we need to the of the of entrepreneurship and economics .
everybody collaborator , his own <unk> and anybody takes a <unk> <unk> part .
and then <unk> we the people , after the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> the <unk> your personal relations and also in one of <unk> .
so for <unk> go there out of our program forth ?
it 's a range , from the <unk> the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> and <unk> .
a very large range and to <unk> ' i 'm going to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> talent and the illusion of the rapid money , it 's very early on the trade with cocaine seduced .
he had always been fun of businesses to run .
he 's then <unk> the first time arrested been .
and these <unk> it 's not very impressed me .
all the opposite .
he says there today , he was at his second <unk> prepared .
<unk> is he then the second time convicted been .
he took then just a therapy part and then the <unk> .
and there was he 'd like he would be <unk> talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september <unk> by being , then october <unk> his agency for <unk> started .
the agency 's <unk> , he can now of life .
he 's very good <unk> <unk> .
he 's going to me here .
who him to each other to talk about them .
and again back to martin that i told him at the story .
martin , after his childhood an education , chef <unk> and ended up in his play in the <unk> <unk> .
and alcohol , and drugs on the <unk> are used to be a cycle very quickly .
he was parallel when <unk> and when <unk> .
twenty years , he that life .
and he says , that he did with this lifestyle to do n't <unk> , <unk> .
one day injured he someone at a <unk> so hard that he then convicted .
he took the <unk> part and that <unk> there 's really his life changed .
he learned how , he too much more force to become more success and more of life , could not his <unk> to endeavor , or without drugs to consume .
and he was from your knowledge so excited that he decided had this would like he would pass .
and he wanted to be part of <unk> .
this has <unk> .
he 's now been about two years ago at us and <unk> our participants in their way towards the freedom , because he knows ourselves that if you really change , and if you have the right tools with the hand get that much more possible , when you often i want .
the basis of these successes are by humans as you .
people that with us in jail , the external events of us to come to our participants in their <unk> , in your personal <unk> to help .
these are our <unk> that <unk> talks at our education , this is students who <unk> , <unk> the <unk> do .
and these are our mentors that our participants right after the <unk> <unk> .
and these people take a lot of our program with .
one example .
we 're on our events an exercise , <unk> .
we stick and in the middle of space a big <unk> our people standing on the one and our <unk> stand on the other .
and i think you different question .
and every time , if someone in this question , right answer <unk> he looked at the line .
and here , what we all together , whether we 're inside the <unk> sit or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and an example of where the differences are , is this question .
i 'm in a call social focal up , i had a family has been looking at once in <unk> was .
there are usually a lot of our participants in front of the line and just very few of our <unk> .
a question that i want to imagine that allow us all together , the <unk> ' i love to them .
and i urge you 're all of all up .
maybe we a bit of light get in the audience .
i can you see .
there are all .
terrific .
thank you .
i <unk> ' you 're a question and if you this question , right answer to put it again , otherwise do you just stand .
this is sort of our line that we now .
i have in my life illegal things done , for the i was punished be able to do it was but not .
if you see this question , right answer to put them , please .
to count , drunk the risks .
to count , maybe too low amounts <unk> obsessed .
to count , it with the driver , in fact .
okay .
and it 's also to be a labor n't always completely accurate up .
all right .
and most .
we have a few angel in the space .
it 's beautiful , there i 'm .
thank you , they 're looking at all back down .
so this question , if we the events are going to get our <unk> very often the <unk> .
and you will also clear , how much , you had .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment , they were growing , with the friends , but also , and that you may not always talking about to get have been if you something the edge of <unk> or even beyond that .
what are the results of our work ?
<unk> percent of our alumni , from within <unk> days after their <unk> the workplace .
this is rapidly as quickly .
<unk> percent , in their own .
one third of donors are in the past year , <unk> .
and our <unk> is seven percent .
i did it has been told the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany , <unk> percent of .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> per year , taxpayers <unk> euros .
and it 's a beautiful <unk> , <unk> what a <unk> of seven percent of a <unk> of these <unk> percent of a <unk> means .
when my father and i put it <unk> founded , we open <unk> of a lot of a crazy kept being .
i was my great <unk> in a big businesses up .
but i have to say , i in my life , not as a <unk> work done .
we would encourage our participants , responsibility to take over .
responsibility , what in your life is happening and most of all responsible for it to take that in your life 's .
it 's not to hide , nothing to <unk> .
because that leads to a new , and gives it 's over again trust to build .
and because it makes me , especially happy and pride in our participants open from your way .
<unk> i 'm a little video with .
film .
so i was convicted of two years and eight months , because dangerous <unk> .
i was because <unk> against the <unk> to three years and 10 months convicted .
i have to <unk> traded .
so , i 've judgment of two years , because dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> 's actually my complete life changed .
and what i think that was this <unk> that are also done .
because there was my , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , <unk> ' i almost say , yeah .
i decided to goals of eyes <unk> .
i decided to have discovered i decided to go forward <unk> .
and you go with a whole other minds and self-esteem of <unk> out .
so that 's more and <unk> without a fixed set goals and then , you stop and again into something <unk> .
with the wrong people together and so no longer .
well , the problem is that many no <unk> , if the out .
and the biggest problem , because it 's an <unk> that you back in the old <unk> coming .
you know , nothing else .
through this <unk> individual <unk> , anyway , what 's where everything offered it has to go all my thinking about me ask yourself , about other , the with problems , the with the society that has to just as these 20 weeks , around .
i 've been <unk> of my first woman <unk> .
and since <unk> six months <unk> ' i went back to her .
so , so , we have a new relationship started .
and because i among other , through this whole <unk> and many other things have changed got .
so much of got ' i 've achieved .
i 'm with my family back in <unk> the education started .
so i work today in my <unk> , <unk> ' i say .
i do , just a <unk> for <unk> .
you have this actually acknowledge that there 's very , many people are the fact , like , for my mentor , also about this time in addition , and actually about being , i do n't know , <unk> engagement , the people .
i 'm grateful that you on the idea at all this is that they were so what do .
i 'm grateful that they even for getting <unk> , and i 'm extremely grateful that i of it be for .
these include course , all the people to support that they were .
i like i with many people in the events in , and the me again and confirmed have this is good , that do .
and that 'll ' i 've also .
and say `` thank you .
they come with us in jail .
each of you have something that we need .
if you our participants in their <unk> help , whether it as the <unk> to us to know if you in a financial support these are .
if you see our program in a new <unk> to do , <unk> subject .
talk about us to .
martin <unk> and i have here today .
and look forward to look at the conversation with them .
thank you .
<unk> i like to <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal <unk> .
in a period in the i do something <unk> was .
there , you do things that .
in <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in <unk> .
there are right now , many ways you how to <unk> deal .
or how to <unk> deal .
anyway , i was <unk> also <unk> .
with my work and so <unk> bit about the <unk> .
what i really of <unk> talk .
and not from real problems .
my problem was i was <unk> and was able to be exactly <unk> like my life in 10 or 20 , 30 years will look .
it was <unk> .
and these <unk> , i found scary .
so <unk> express .
what i had a <unk> <unk> crisis .
<unk> the private .
i knew i just ca n't do i the <unk> way to go ?
do it was just feel comfortable ?
or what if i mean <unk> again new <unk> ?
and look , then what happens .
and then on me wait .
that were so the idea .
i was in this time a free <unk> at a <unk> .
as i <unk> .
the <unk> was for me , despite <unk> the absolute <unk> .
you <unk> for the world lives in very good hotels and <unk> the land on a very <unk> kind of the way .
<unk> but occasionally , very <unk> countries .
developing countries where it be more to see and say there was about <unk> villages to kind <unk> local people who , though they do n't have , for happiness and joy <unk> .
right of these images and <unk> lives but a <unk> now .
and that was for me after a while the , .
i was the what i did a little bit .
to <unk> .
moreover , i found it 's a little <unk> of me about a country to write to <unk> that i 'm not really know .
so i wanted to change .
i wanted to countries in each other .
and <unk> was writing .
and to my personal interest to be breastfeeding .
how to you are better know ?
and you with the people living .
in the people living in them home .
not in the hotel .
and you start with the challenges and with the problems of people busy .
and so you with the people who works .
at this was the answer that i wanted to the question be able .
and that i wanted to do .
moreover , i wanted something meaningful .
i wanted a major contribution afford .
something good .
and this sense , at me , at a <unk> even further the .
i was that 's been a lot in developing world , nepal i was just a particularly touched .
until <unk> was there a <unk> civil war , not only of orphans but also lots of and social problems left .
with an annual income of <unk> dollars , nepal the poorest country in south asia .
and count continue to the 20 poorest countries in the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the <unk> .
nearly one fifth of the population has to malnutrition .
<unk> percent of adults could n't read and writing .
all these facts connected with a very personal stories and <unk> that i want to this journey witnessed met me in a period in the i was willing and frankly , for change .
and i myself to change .
and drum , after my return of nepal my decision .
i quit my job .
and <unk> like to the aid .
and i <unk> ' now , just an excerpt from the answer <unk> that i 'm going to my <unk> received .
because they just a <unk> was .
it 's about a <unk> <unk> at <unk> international <unk> company .
and not about a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> to hold of time in nepal , they want and a funding of <unk> addiction .
hi ?
we go on ?
my <unk> was really serious meaning and well .
at least i thought that .
and the answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really down .
and got the course you a very emotional response written .
and fortunately , never <unk> .
so i ' i started this but really intense sense , and what good <unk> .
i used as an engine , to my own company to form .
<unk> .
heart <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
a company that basically what this is , what i was looking .
because the possibility , a country unlike the time traveling .
the possibility , a country gets really know .
and i with the people in place , and work .
and it 's not anywhere work , but in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you can actually in two words break .
so <unk> and <unk> .
that means for the place , you good <unk> data .
the you 're doing good .
and that now <unk> little bit <unk> .
it 's but not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use the tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
or take advantage we <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , <unk> and tourism .
because the people with us go do while their <unk> useful <unk> .
you pay for their journey , like a different <unk> .
but they travel . it differently .
they live in <unk> .
and the main thing is not as a recovery or as much <unk> but real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and <unk> .
to engage in our people have to <unk> and interests in different projects .
we can go through our work for one <unk> tourism , regions promote the otherwise no opportunity to the classic tourism .
because just the to infrastructure to missing .
for others can we sustainable projects .
we can own sustainable projects <unk> and fund .
we pay for us so a hundred percent .
also are not on giving on .
and that 's just for our long <unk> engagement of meaning .
started , we with our work <unk> in nepal .
<unk> year we our engagement in uganda <unk> .
and so after about four years turns out of us now i 've got married and my husband and i also are <unk> a team of <unk> question .
let 's the <unk> way to go ?
or what if we have larger than thinking ?
so the <unk> even further believe ?
if we do with this is not just social engagement and sustainable of my but development in the wholeness capture ?
and in the individual <unk> <unk> ?
or even <unk> individual <unk> .
that would then what a new an enterprise .

in other <unk> but the philosophy of <unk> .
we want to this ?
was the next question .
<unk> new business ?
sure we want to this .
we love entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we 'll <unk> .
because we have the same language .
because we the dreams dreams .
because we have the challenges .
and so we have this year <unk> a nurse given .
<unk> .
and with <unk> promote the creative companies in its development and <unk> <unk> that we 've gone through <unk> people .
and <unk> we have the participants , entrepreneur , or staff of creative companies with individual development <unk> .
so <unk> the personal social and <unk> <unk> of <unk> include .
and <unk> the <unk> prepare .
that there at <unk> , again .
and using the next to a <unk> <unk> another one another <unk> .
he shows a in relatively short time , where you , or where you <unk> .
where you may still <unk> prejudice .
where you might be a bit more flexible , to <unk> in thinking .
and he shows a , what you really good .
this leads to its strength of eyes .
so it the creativity , suddenly , great .
or is it the serenity that you can be new way to be detected .
and serenity and assume that you can not can change .
and the force , things to change that you can change .
and you can be very much .
already in very short time .
we know that .
one example , .
these are <unk> rose <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
these are five very beautiful women in uganda .
so sad <unk> and talent .
they <unk> beautiful , <unk> <unk> for years .
and for years was nothing .
because they simply no market for it had .
because they do n't know , the quality can improve .
because you one has said , which to be in the question .
we wanted to these women .
and have so this year , a <unk> started .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
what the people of poverty go .
and you an income .
a future .
we 're yesterday with our <unk> live .
and we start with a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> of thousands <unk> of our women .
and sell it brings them not just for a year an income .
it allows us as well , the project , much bigger .
this first <unk> is like social crowd <unk> and <unk> in a .
so who do want to do this one of the purchase a necklace , the other , he but with us , right into the project travel .
he can to the women travel , and <unk> .
in the we want to do n't just five women to work , but fifty or a hundred .
and not only in uganda , but in nepal , and in other <unk> , where we <unk> work .
about this is but this <unk> just a project from our integrated cycle of projects .
we work in all the central areas .
in <unk> <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work in one of just too much .
what happens with the kids when the women who work ?
right .
so we have this year in nepal , and in uganda , two <unk> centre , .
all he grabs in our own cycle in love .
and it makes more sense , every one project for yourself .
collaborator place where we 've ever going <unk> in the different projects .
the exact opportunities are , and just in the common .
and the closing , i 'm going to directly on a journey to take .
and so i urge you in the eyes to close .
<unk> ' you before you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on a <unk> <unk> .
and are satisfied and up .
you 've just with your <unk> at noon eaten .
there was <unk> .
<unk> .
delicious .
the walls are <unk> .
here in fact , it warm .
you <unk> of the window .
and see kids on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet <unk> the sand on .
you <unk> on your <unk> .
also on them is a thin layer <unk> dust .
the kids were laughing .
and calls for your name .
you <unk> you , you to you , no longer just <unk> .
<unk> .
you know how the late , it .
but about to do you get up .
and the <unk> , on the you have the kids were , <unk> .
so at the street is a tree .
here are you see you with <unk> meet .
in the meadow sitting in the shadow of <unk> you the new design of <unk> to .
how to you with your hands and feet .
later , nor the other women on .
you smile , you <unk> .
until you with your <unk> <unk> .
under the tree .
in .
amazing that it 's still internet .
this morning <unk> you back with your coach .
and <unk> you .
the exchange , every time valuable .
moreover , it 's beautiful time again german to talk .
you <unk> music .
and that <unk> of <unk> .
she goes <unk> is in <unk> the pots .
they sing an african song .
you are relaxed i 'm happy .
you the eyes back on .
each of us can see the <unk> to meet , something new <unk> .
or at a short time that cube , to throw away .
and to look what happens .
thank you .
before i start , i think , whether of you today at night , which they 're here , the time someone <unk> house occupied .
i <unk> ' with the light 's not really good , but maybe you want to someone comes up .
down here <unk> ' i want one .
two .
here to go up <unk> ' i 'm not , but anyway , down here are already have two , that 's nice , we are already have to <unk> .
i said , which is also a building occupied and it 's the <unk> mountain in east of the city <unk> .
this is the building .
together with 20 other people have ' i the <unk> the last summer , six months for occupied .
and so <unk> ' i want one of them .
well , and , like now some of you might say .
what do it 's what ?
<unk> are so many .
but i want it briefly .
well what you occupied now the <unk> ?
and you <unk> then the park or how ?
just a variety of the to , friends , colleagues asked , when you know , that i 'm part of an initiative , i <unk> ' , something <unk> name , <unk> am .
all expected that we transition in the front of <unk> <unk> .
and here around these <unk> <unk> up , <unk> common and banner up .
and to the privatization of <unk> to <unk> .
but who i know , you know that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was also not the elected <unk> the initiative .
what we see here is a sign of <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
this is a public space , a private , and so for many people do n't look at is , <unk> ' i do n't say , but you do n't in public hand , and it 's not be used to how to public spaces may take advantage .
we were a group of <unk> unites the desire to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , sensitive and sustainable deal .
and we wanted to another <unk> tell .
we were a <unk> team and that i have now very quickly see , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , urban planning social -- , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , , design , music , photography <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
so at once again with different social cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspective <unk> and <unk> .
and we allowed to different skills but also in various networks <unk> .
and creative part <unk> solutions in the <unk> that we then did , <unk> to realize .
we actually navigated to <unk> to occupy .
however , it 's why we <unk> with stories and ideas in .
we have to memories and images asked .
and from these memories and images out to the sorts of perspective for the <unk> to develop .
it was it 's important that the process , <unk> remains .
us as an initiative to do we have to always a <unk> platform , and when <unk> terms .
this was <unk> a <unk> and <unk> in and became , and after a <unk> .
on the experiences that we really did , <unk> ' i want go .
every city has <unk> places .
the one in a face .
in many of this is <unk> and <unk> and be in the result of citizens by strangers places perceived temperature .
they are the dead places a city because they just to do that are , what we were in public space expect .
so , for that we <unk> , <unk> .
are these , but also the in public , the urban places neglected , it 's <unk> .
initiatives , these places her back to stay often , <unk> interest in the <unk> stick .
what 's also with me to do n't like here some questions , like some way out of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places give our city 's not just a face .
no .
they are the social places of the city , in our social life is happening .
so do we can often very first <unk> ties to our neighbors , when we look at random on the way to go shopping meet .
and can see this into , if we just a <unk> have to sit , and we actually stop , if the spaces , <unk> designed .
and we just <unk> longer <unk> .
this is <unk> , sometimes .
but with certainty , is a sense of community .
the more encounters i 'm here in such a public space was on the faster and the more likely , but also the community .
and when i do n't <unk> , then arises of this , what you probably the anonymity a <unk> .
we were then two challenges .
we can look at the citizens consciousness , responsibility and commitment to their neighborhood <unk> or in <unk> also <unk> .
how can protest in the creation be transformed ?
how do , in ideas will be transformed ?
protest against the privatization and <unk> this <unk> <unk> places and , against the growing and actually also not <unk> <unk> of the same places .
so you now , which they 're sitting , even before , they beat the newspaper , and read this text .
love <unk> and citizens , we invite you a we want you three of options for the <unk> of <unk> imagine that it 's been very carefully <unk> <unk> designed .
they 're in <unk> at the idea of the variation pick .
and the variation in the most <unk> will then <unk> implemented .
they would go ?
would anyone from them to this event go ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it just a great .
there 's <unk> way , what <unk> .
they 're <unk> , like this in order to look like .
and as i said , it just a great the first moment .
i 'm trying ' i still working on an explanation .
and it , because i was the opinion , you ca n't really <unk> or pick or <unk> , <unk> .
first because classic <unk> 's too late <unk> .
so , mostly they have n't have an opportunity , really your suggestions to make or some alternatives to discuss , but there are actually been <unk> design and they 're <unk> still going to see if you <unk> or <unk> in the urban green plants .
or , as a friend who recently , what color the trash , for example .
second thing that classical <unk> 's rarely spoke about information and vote out .
think about the three <unk> options .
we have here is that we want to show you and you can then <unk> .
frustration and <unk> are often the implications for what i also somehow understand think .
so anyway , no choice about <unk> or <unk> , when i really rather <unk> <unk> way of <unk> <unk> had .
it 's it differently .
although at the <unk> the existing <unk> a conversation cost has , we ultimately much <unk> experience .
so we experience <unk> and i 'm going to other <unk> .
i want to pass on other initiatives , at each other projects , but also , and mostly in the city and the policy .
because of those who are capable of these <unk> actually run , and the kind of these kinds of these are .
if you really the interest in one at is , as it so often <unk> and out , then we need and then we need the <unk> new <unk> .
ca n't last <unk> ' i but also , they all that you here today .
and it 's so , because i <unk> for a really think .
i hold on it 's important that they all go , and i want them with our example encourage the <unk> a chance .
and i <unk> me of them all , because you who are capable of the <unk> a new <unk> <unk> .
we have at look like to look at the citizens consciousness , responsibility and commitment to their neighborhood and like to involvement and <unk> to <unk> ?
one willingness to have to <unk> .
in <unk> hit the professionals in <unk> , citizens in <unk> and different interests each other .
what we see here is a <unk> , which we invited to have .
what we see here , are some <unk> and <unk> the conversation with citizens .
the goal to be that all those conversations on <unk> take place , so that not the <unk> interests , or the <unk> skills across the skills the citizens .
the citizens to stand up there are experts , they 're experts to their neighborhood you know , what you are missing , which <unk> them with a place , in which tradition a place , and also , what you a place is missing .
the <unk> , especially in the city will be able to do is on <unk> level in the project <unk> .
in <unk> or in a particular case , then another <unk> involved in the issues <unk> that just on the project <unk> , ever since .
it leads to a <unk> , where all of information for all available , and then the place of .
and maybe even trace to be able to an identification of <unk> allows us .
a dialogue , <unk> also means that the wishes of <unk> really seriously , .
and it 's also then , if somebody says , i want to a <unk> next to the <unk> .
it 's obviously in <unk> , but the goal to be , in <unk> dialog with all of <unk> , which is the solution , and maybe in <unk> then , <unk> <unk> , but maybe in one another place .
as i said , that 's got out of the dialogue out and form .
second point is <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> is <unk> .
one feels a really comfortable , when he was <unk> great group , and talk .
the other , which is good writing , but the text and not before <unk> great group .
the other draws might be a photograph .
or make his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i 'm going to say it 's different <unk> give a different <unk> of .
we have here , for the possibility , just to come , there , the first time watch , what happens .
in <unk> small exhibition .
we have here to had to <unk> .
we have the possibility had to paint .
we have the possibility had to write .
regardless of the age .
this was a <unk> girl .
we had the possibility of our ideas with their faces to connect to play with the <unk> .
the way , outside of <unk> <unk> to participate , should be given .
it can take over a <unk> happen , that can think about <unk> <unk> happen .
the <unk> and transparent availability of the results that the dialogue under the <unk> .
we even have the whole process in parallel on facebook with and on one of independent blog , and at the news <unk> about a <unk> .
our third thing <unk> .
you remember , maybe that i said that <unk> often too late take place .
in my <unk> event there 's been three finished <unk> .
<unk> is the process but then when he early place and the <unk> in <unk> to do n't know what , with <unk> area that happen .
if you by the dialogue , and so i 'm going to the point of gotten , <unk> is that are scenarios for an area in the question .
<unk> is actually also for <unk> itself .
and that then , if not from beginning of <unk> is that the <unk> event , and so look , but on the experiences from the previous can .
what 's happening , if the citizens your city <unk> and your city <unk> .
is already in numerous projects .
i ' point is an example from <unk> , that 's the <unk> , is likely to thank you know .
in new york was just a project launched , there 's a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> there are in six weeks <unk> dollars to come to the funding to make them or at <unk> .
the time has to be in august , the politics could n't think differently , when the idea of their own .
also the <unk> in new york , which i <unk> ' i 'm not going to say , because it by now to one of the <unk> the city has it was no idea of politics or administration .
the contrary , the <unk> for the <unk> were already .
in <unk> , so we go back in germany , the citizens to <unk> plans to <unk> one <unk> , again <unk> .
the city was told <unk> 's not necessary .
the four weeks <unk> that we have to <unk> <unk> , the different than <unk> .
today is the <unk> the city offline .
during the side <unk> d e wonderful work , and the city of the <unk> the initiative that there was founded , and other <unk> .
<unk> paint people their own <unk> on the street .
in rotterdam in a <unk> <unk> .
all this far , want you say .
then we do but now just so forth .
but i think it wrong , the city of responsibility .
why ?
for one , because they have a look for the whole , or have .
during the <unk> , let 's own citizens initiatives , businesses in the rule in a for them in some form <unk> part on the city against the responsibility for their projects that are also the edge of attention .
and the other end of course , if the city of the projects does that are different tools at .
a <unk> initiative , this just <unk> <unk> .
also our goal was actually a temporary initiative that for her going to was about half a year of the results and the responsibility to the city to .
current state of <unk> has the <unk> in january went out .
it run a negotiation .
so we have , at the problem that we have n't <unk> .
but we know , now , that when the city the <unk> successful <unk> when the negotiation actually succeed , that then a <unk> take place .
in which one form of place is more open .
and finally , to my belief that many projects , because of meaning , complexity or even the cost of the city has evolved to be a chance of happiness consent , and identification .
if you just in time and the dialogue with the citizens <unk> .
in each of town and citizens .
in each of town and you all that you today i 'm here .
if we to demand and at the quality of the <unk> the citizens no more than annoying would perceive , but as <unk> .
that 's it .
last night and <unk> we were here in <unk> in <unk> and are so the <unk> .
we talked about <unk> .
so this idea , <unk> second chance to have , if it in this is not <unk> , then , and again <unk> second chance .
we found very exciting .
and we were actually relatively quickly to agree that there are two things are that we do n't and again , did .
this one is the puberty .
the second there was also immediately is the table and again to school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you remember , maybe even <unk> out <unk> .
at me , yes , now , the <unk> years ago , but the words to lead to immediately started to <unk> hands .
my neck <unk> , and i just want back on the <unk> .
and then i know , how it at them , but in my exams , then , the of the <unk> seriously the fact , who was always the next to me .
no idea what the fact .
they 're going to understand it , so , my school was n't really nice and after i then my final <unk> behind me , was perfectly clear , never going to school .
and what should i 'm saying , when i 'm on the year <unk> <unk> some of the most days , i spent was , i ' i in schools spent .
with a desire and fully to be .
how it 's about this ?
how could it happen ?
it started first time with that something happened , which i do n't expect .
i got kids .
so , my wife was given the children .
and it was then also very clear that you one is that in this <unk> to take care .
to the one day , when she said , honey it 's <unk> .
and today to leave you down .
yes , <unk> .
and opened in the door and then i sat there 's basically in this <unk> , whoa , i felt <unk> in the <unk> .
this is that , like it back in way .
and that <unk> , like to school at <unk> , and i <unk> ' me , human being here , yes real <unk> changed .
and when i then the teacher to tell you heard and you know , the kids learn not for the school , but it 's live there <unk> ' i , oh my god , the sentence was ' i do that 's not <unk> .
what is that , what we from the high school , from this high school in fact that 's life really <unk> have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really good thing .
where they actually in their <unk> it 's really good need ?
and maybe you know some more , like the capital from yugoslavia means .
what 's time yugoslavia .
or <unk> , this ability within a time as much more knowledge of <unk> , just so that i then on <unk> again <unk> , to me feel bad ?
well , i ' that 's needed to <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what 's a <unk> from one point is about it out whether someone 's a good doctor ?
if the <unk> is and if the good <unk> properties ?
no way .
so , no way , it 's life , not for the school we learn .
if we have that look back , about <unk> years , the middle of <unk> century , like that you voted .
this is the time , in germany , <unk> then at some of introduced .
and where the system , as we now , has its roots .
and if we have the time now imagine , it was actually so that people at the had no access to know your time .
and there were these four or six years , which they sort of forced , to school to go and to know <unk> were these were then really the only way that had to the knowledge and the facts and the information from your time in touch .
today , a <unk> more information in his pocket and the library of <unk> time .
and the middle of <unk> century , that was the time the <unk> .
so , there 's a change in the world and there were suddenly people are required that these new machines 're able to .
simultaneously , but also people are required that these machines wait , and repair .
and we did people that these machines build , and these are <unk> .
may recognize them it .
this <unk> system that we have today in germany , lots and yet , has its root in this time .
and , there might make sense .
also , because it was probably wo n't really like that was that , what i in school because i 've got on for the work on the assembly well , who the assembly line , who stood there his entire life .
we do <unk> looking at the future .
let 's the <unk> century , where it is , and let 's the year <unk> .
this year <unk> was the year , there was the first <unk> just about to pop .
i was with my studying finished and i thought , here 's the point , here are you know their own , the first one company .
yes , after some to me around like the internet , <unk> ' i , then <unk> ' i 'm also time .
and some corporations are to us <unk> and got bigger and and bigger and , and we are so beautiful slow grown , and some of the companies are then to us again , in case <unk> .
you can be used to two times in life .
and we were then after a few years , but 30 staff .
so , we had such a growth and we had been so exciting professions on how <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
, i do n't know if you <unk> concrete idea , what these people do but when i went to school , we had no idea that it so what ever give it would .
even when i <unk> did was kind of such thing as the internet is n't talk .
and the kids who we 're going to school to the job , the in 10 , fifteen years , 20 or 30 years ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and what do the facts are the need to in those future jobs to ?
and if you will be honest , also because the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 've been so in the future looking who could tell me because the <unk> for a saturday .
there 's <unk> <unk> , i ' i read .
well , you see , they have no idea .
like that we then went out what to school for the life to do ?
what are the things we need to kids for the life to stay to do ?
and maybe it 's a look at least in this , which are going on staff .
so this is yes , <unk> from school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and universities are then in the company .
and if you look like <unk> classic <unk> at right , then , then on the first place , so what the expertise .
you want to the right , so the way , so , we 're looking <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and about 12 years in abroad .
this is going to school , and also in the future ca n't afford .
what school , but perhaps , but that could , are the things that 's important , are the this so-called <unk> <unk> and i realized that these <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the future will be .
and you can and basically in three groups .
this is one , and desire to staff , the flexible , and flexibility it 's a .
you want to almost all their employees to <unk> thinking .
and then they want to these companies employees , the <unk> .
so we flexibility <unk> thinking and <unk> .
we start with the flexibility .
this is relatively fast understand .
if we look at the economy to work , how fast , yes , how fast is all change .
<unk> , whole business models are the internet of the morning in the head .
and practice , i employees , working with this change deal .
and practice , i employees , the creative .
and practice , i employees , the <unk> .
it 's pretty the opposite of what in the factory end of <unk> century of staff the assembly needed .
also the second issue that entrepreneurial think is quite sure .
there 's about the responsibility .
there 's about people who take responsibility .
first time , and their own life .
but also for the big whole .
whether this now the company , or even as a wish we people who take responsibility for the big whole .
and the third factor that <unk> that 's almost the most <unk> .
and if we look at the football <unk> remember , then there 's there on this beautiful saying .
argentina , <unk> <unk> portugal , <unk> and germany has a team .
it was n't <unk> <unk> that <unk> won .
that were able to the only in common .
and as someone , this big innovator who our time , steve jobs , <unk> .
it was n't matter of the iphone invented , who has not the <unk> invented , who has itunes n't invented , who has nothing about it was invented .
who had a team that this possible did , because just as a team of the that 's what they did .

but there 's <unk> fourth thing and it 's me almost more important .
and that is learning .
if the only thing that we think about the future for saying , is that they 're not is that 's the ability to again and new to learn and fun , to have to learn to see the <unk> that we in <unk> life , and that our children in <unk> , they succeeded .

but where i was ?
i sat in this <unk> and the of you who have kids who know that this is not just <unk> event , for you <unk> pay .
so <unk> event for the motto of all , but not yet from any .
to the point , where <unk> elected , there are then suddenly all of invisible .
now , i sat there and what should i say , the <unk> one of my kids were these <unk> , the <unk> parts of the event .
less fun , it was for me as a father , if you so the stress around the homework and learn the whole family life <unk> .
and even less fun doing it , if the child sick , because in school stress has .
and finally ended up these <unk> or was a peak of <unk> the school , again , <unk> <unk> .
in fact it was no <unk> , it was more like a <unk> , right after the hour and in fact , we were also the single parents who were invited .
and i <unk> ' you now and also to the details by the point was clear , we have to our child 's <unk> that 's not .
<unk> , but two years , where we <unk> , there 's something .
what are we 're really wrong ?
and we had to actually the question is is our child is broken ?
and we are the only , where it ?

there are lots of , where it very similar to go and this was two years ago , because i sat with <unk> <unk> together we were just , a company to form , during us about where the journey to go , and the we sat on the bar and have to private things <unk> .
and what should i say , he was almost the same story with his children did he almost the same thing is how we , and we had the lucky that we our children 's take could get out of the school , yeah ?
in berlin , there on <unk> <unk> of different schools and we could even <unk> to consider .
but can that anyone out there ?
it was at the a little bit , our children in safety to and these <unk> out there be that , how they are .
and after we 're both right now , the sense , school , since we were there 's not really changed we thought , yes , we are the first of the issue going to do .
it 's how shall we as <unk> there anything ?
the good is that we <unk> .
we 're not alone .
but we actually relatively fast <unk> whole range of great people found that what do anything like to how we , <unk> to create that all <unk> of .
it 's not so that just the children and their parents under the suffering , what out there 's happening .
if we the teachers at , 30 percent of teachers have <unk> .
if we look at the way to the number <unk> in the last 10 years ago , has the has doubled .
it can now be that all parents and wrong ?
that all children were broken , and that also the teacher is broken ?
or it can be that we have a system , which simply no more like that fit , like this <unk> ago <unk> years , who does n't have no longer , right .
and we have many people found that it that went and we even people found that do n't have kids .
and they 've got them to take responsibility to ask for the future that they take responsibility to ask for the future , is they take responsibility for this is what we our children and the kids who are going to school , with on the way .
and we have a look <unk> second point <unk> there are out there <unk> whole range of great initiatives , the school to change , and there are there 's <unk> schools , here and there really neat <unk> and there 's almost on every school teachers who really involved , and to change .
and it 's even the one or other bold principal , and then also <unk> the first step .
and how we should now as <unk> ?
we had , no idea that 's going to help .
but we can one thing , we can go into those schools and we can remember that are the people that school is , so the parents , the teachers and the students , together and we can work with in two days <unk> whole lot .
there are so people together , in the more like each other 've and the learning in two days , what it together to work .
they come with <unk> of concrete challenge of them together .
and after two of days , and then , for a new <unk> , or the <unk> given to <unk> completely new high as we in berlin school in <unk> allowed to .
or who have concrete things for <unk> problems that you in their school , evolved .
and within two days in developed <unk> that the next day to them will .
but what the <unk> is what about these two days , and that makes it for me then as beautiful the few <unk> that i said , then also time in schools in , germany to spend , is that energy that there 's when the three things .
if the three things together to experience , so what the flexibility <unk> .
so basically <unk> thinking and if you a team to experience .
then that is such a <unk> , the <unk> .
and if we are four weeks after that <unk> <unk> in such <unk> to come back then being so that , the school as a whole started , to change that there <unk> completely new culture was .
and this is incredibly <unk> .
and i <unk> ' you 'd like to talk to school to think .
i <unk> ' you 'd like to school .
and i <unk> ' you , also like , about to school , to talk .
talk about this , what you like it 's talk about the , what you do n't like it .
they will be surprised , how much <unk> you get and how many people the same have , but just not about it .
let 's let 's every single school in germany to <unk> century .
let 's the entire system .
and let 's this together to do with the people to school day for a day off , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because it together , we can create .
thank you .
