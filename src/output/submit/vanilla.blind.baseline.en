yes , good day mean , ladies , gentlemen .
very much . thanks for the invitation , here today to talk .
and i have to me , yes , now ourselves , imagine .
my name is christian <unk> and i 'm going to strange term , <unk> the city of food .
that are called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : one personnel to the second is an organization , , the public 's fine .
so i 'm for the <unk> this city in charge .
and yes , you do it , not very popular .
i know .
and it out , and this is something what my son , particularly like , i 'm also <unk> .
that means that i 'm the head of <unk> fire .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and have i thought , of course , is a theme important , , i do you today <unk> want .
which with the theme of <unk> , because , that 's part of the firemen .
we hope on the best and we 're us on the worst of years ago , that has jack that once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then i start something not , so serious to say .
i <unk> you a able to .
so talk , we , if it 's a risk is that we briefly , a disaster are , for example <unk> <unk> , rush .
many people are the way .
it and urges , it <unk> .
and somewhere in the edge is a suitcase , lonely , leave , something <unk> , maybe <unk> with <unk> .
nobody seems to belong .
the suitcase heard any .
suddenly a <unk> .
leave you that <unk> .
the police comes to fire , <unk> .
people out .
officials <unk> .
they go out .
what 's because we go ? , asking <unk> .
that we know , not or we ca n't it 's say .
the people leave the building .
kids who cry .
some of falling , maybe even , because it all very quickly go to .
suddenly , who .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic , breaks out .
i hear now here on .
the rest <unk> i your imagination .
but it 's no fantasy , that i <unk> . <unk> ?
right now this is , in this week is happening in <unk> .
there 's a such a suitcase are stuck .
afterwards , , that only , in <unk> , nine pounds of drugs in there were .
but the people were exactly like , and that has a friend told me that tells , from the building <unk> .
it was nothing said .
and it was right , who suddenly , at least in the group on , my friend , my friend , found myself .
god was very much is n't panic <unk> , otherwise would be the are not so safe out how it .
you see , in a <unk> , in a <unk> disaster is communication in a very important .
communication is so important , because the people in this situation where literally after the communications <unk> .
they want to know what 's because we go .
it used in the good , old was time that for the authorities , simple .
we 've just ca n't told or we 've got lied .
why ?
because the thing called <unk> was for .
you , so i justified to say , the people get in panic , say , we 'd not the truth or we say the <unk> .
this is in a time the social media , in a time of twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of the private and public <unk> , in a time of <unk> and public television is not more possible .
just and <unk> so , because it was one is not be moral is , and secondly , mostly are anyway , the past , agency , the event to report .
you remember , may still , the <unk> in the hudson river , , is , some of the year , ago .
the first reporting on it was at twitter .
of someone , on a ferry was , and just and <unk> immediately <unk> , here 's a plane <unk> and we save the people now .
that was no <unk> .
you see , we 're going to <unk> , these days just and <unk> of the first place the truth to say , and very <unk> to inform .
because most are of course we also the past , supposedly , the truth , know , because we as agency , to say , to pay attention , we just <unk> information to pass .
that are public media , or , private media , either not so , in touch or they do it just also not .
of so , we will be in the food , and that 's also something that , even by the media has gone are , we think about how we in the future with <unk> deal .
and that we 're going to the good old <unk> back out .
however , just as a form of <unk> .
that means we 're in the next few years about a hundred <unk> in the <unk> build the , some of you know that still , <unk> , if it just to <unk> coming .
it used it was so .
you might know they still , three times in short , once in short , once a long and even just means .
i know it 's not more .
we 're going to the right now in human beings with all <unk> , we , of the have , so <unk> , about facebook , about twitter , the radio <unk> also at night , the television and all over the internet and the local media and so , and immediately , to the course , with <unk> , to pick up the information on to get .
and we know , we need to get there 's very quickly and <unk> operate and we need to get there 's very quickly and <unk> inform , because the <unk> and citizens to be otherwise <unk> .
and we ultimately , not more that , what we tell you want .
communication in the crisis , or in the disaster is so one a question of the speed , all media , the us to stand , and it 's also a question of the credibility .
credibility that 's our biggest problem , because the <unk> and citizens to say , either , oh , the 're time again , right now all not , they say , the <unk> us , it 's all much worse than it in reality is .
we have so , too good experience done with facebook and twitter , still , recently .
also that you have perhaps some of in them the media from .
we have a <unk> in the food <unk> had .
and it 's a thing called the chemical bomb .

the problem is just , many of bombs 've never works and are , like , in <unk> under one in the food <unk> .
and there , we were from a older gentleman , be some extent , how he so beautiful in the protocol , <unk> wanted , we were now , he had seen as you <unk> <unk> like it 's and now <unk> , he the authorities , about getting informed that there 's a bomb , is . laughter throughout the background
the way since i have , of the older and gentlemen , reported in all <unk> .
we 're going to see , what we still do everything we find .
this bombs to immediately , place , not <unk> be , but in fact .
and so we then in <unk> park , just and <unk> a , in every sense of the word , a bomb <unk> .
and time in the history of the city of the communications , facebook and twitter to walk , let me with the consequence of the entire <unk> far over <unk> <unk> total , followed .
and the media was thrilled . laughter throughout the background .
we had n't even with the phone , but the have <unk> and <unk> , everything about <unk> and twitter .
that all had a great effect for us , because the credibility that is by increased about these social media .
just so , they have to me also a sign give , when i 'll stop to .
i can go from here 's not , the watch out .
this is the credibility that , because the first of these social media , the advantage to have to you very much information to pass .
not so very <unk> are , because the members of the there and tweeting or the <unk> , as you call them , a high <unk> .
secondly , fast <unk> .
if anything not true to write that someone who immediately , so the credibility that the i just talked to have to clear up , because that the entire community in principle , the <unk> involved .
and it 's a very high <unk> so , so if anything wrong is , it can also very quickly <unk> be .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> , the exciting found , as a bomb went in <unk> park up .
of so we 've come from all the things that the last few years happened are , and it are much more <unk> happens when <unk> a still think , as <unk> one knows .
also the city of food , every day of such a disaster home for .
a bomb , in fact to be in a park , is certainly not a like .
but they can also , and also then <unk> we now , in <unk> be found , and then i 'm we there with our <unk> and try to the in seven meters deep <unk> .
and if the , you think , munich , you think , other cities , if the then the fact to be , because they just a so-called <unk> , the you have conventional not to defuse that can , then we know , now , be a variety of houses , after that 's not more so look like before .
and that to communicate it 's important , one hand , because it just in a in a world <unk> <unk> at need is , communication to do to that i also be freaked out to prevent , to try to worry about to carry the people to be informed are , to try to worry about to carry the people in the are able , on these difficult situation to .
and the social media to help us , and , <unk> to be , because ultimately , they all , the communications are involved are , and it 's not just a <unk> <unk> is how we that in the <unk> , <unk> and certainly , still in the <unk> , large part .
of why is today <unk> not just a job of the authorities , not just a job of the fire or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , red cross et <unk> , but about communication in the catastrophe and <unk> a catastrophe about us all .
and <unk> this has shown .
there 's about twitter and about facebook , a lot of the aid did , if you also partially you still so overwhelmed was , because suddenly <unk> of people to any <unk> build to and you know what does n't even more , where the <unk> .
this shows , there 's still much to do , also for the public realm of communication in <unk> , but the unprecedented solidarity with the <unk> and the <unk> has just shown that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication to do n't even more to think .
and i hope that i do you a little bit of that have to this medium , that yes , for the beautiful things of life often used to , also in <unk> its meaning and purpose of and that we as a city , for the for the <unk> charge is , this instrument living in the future , still very new , and very different well , you 're going to her , to the citizens to use the <unk> and citizens and so the end i now , and <unk> me very much for your attention , when i do you the entire time , barely seen .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , just had already have heard .
and i 'm now , also , and , a own <unk> to the reasons .
what it is , there <unk> produce 'm going to that i 'll tell you also in a few years ago .
before that 's what i 'm doing , i have to but a few things <unk> .
the first is , , i believe that we stories , really , life .
that we no stories are n't you could live .
and i believe that 's very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories , there , as the entertainment business actually produced .
then i think , that the internet , an of , of fact that well as anybody <unk> really neat <unk> will .
and fourth , i 'm <unk> of that convinced that people that were created , creative .
and that you happier , are , once they 're creative be allowed to .
ever more people happy , are , <unk> better , it 's about the world .
very logical .
these better world is now , but just a byproduct .
in the first line , i 'm going to already said , a storyteller .
and the story , i tell you want to start to be midnight , in a <unk> , in the just happy <unk> singing .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now gets you of the <unk> and the singing , not so much with , because in the moment , in the it at midnight 's become , something happens with her .
it 's something happens in your head , in your body , with their perception .
and they did n't really words .
they do n't know , there just happened .
i but words .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see the a side <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and everything is quite a white .
i ' that sense , i 'm somehow , quite <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other , we have the two , then the country of oz -- with very very much color .
and it was , of the first told that i 'd better <unk> and write , when that i draw .
so , the first , what <unk> now with their new perceptions , you see , is a stranger man with <unk> <unk> hair , the years ago , is , you very seriously at and says , very much congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> about it on , to a very special kind of people .
she was as <unk> born .
players are people , the ab your <unk> age to your lifetime of play .
of you who knows <unk> ?
very beautiful .
imagine if you ago , the <unk> at <unk> n't swords , if you one another meet , but <unk> of the pocket .
so these cube , <unk> , <unk> , all sorts of things .
what really important is the players have no insight on their <unk> .
we know , yes , not , when we die .
i wish that each of a long life , but we know what 's just not .
it can also the morning , everything , over to be .
and so it 's in my players , .
you know what does n't want to how they because actually can play .
that means , again , every lost a minute , the last been to be .
a player , his entire lifetime <unk> , <unk> the moment of <unk> as a candle at the <unk> will .
now you can , of course , if that because that is dangerous , why are playing the then at all ?
the answer is very clear : that .
without play , without any players to a around , <unk> , all of gray , and only when a player does , he is actually alive .
the were able to play born .
so .
this story of <unk> and as you now the world , the players <unk> , your first of it , and , of course , inevitably , <unk> love , that 's the story , i tell you want .
and it in the form of <unk> .
the first season , twelve follow , sorry , i 'm here is a <unk> happens , i just to be late seen .
so , twelve follow the first season , with a length of one five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a result , after the other , beautiful <unk> told that you know .
that television , for his <unk> nothing else .
this is not new .
and if it 's all be , about , i now one is finished .
and also do n't here .
now it 's but just right .
we go , to <unk> back .
what 's the most set out of the movie or from the series ?
it can just a give , right .
thanks .
as if we that i practiced have .
and that 's exactly true on my players , which is not to .
of which is it 's very , many would be .
there 's so many different games .
you think just , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so on .
and exactly like <unk> 's also the number , the players .
and so be here of stories , all told you want to be .
now would be the next question : who do that because everything about ?
i ' , a quite high think of me .
i me for <unk> smart , and extremely creative .
but i know that hundreds of brains more to produce as just one , also if it 's mine .
so it came right to the idea that you the crowd , in the creative process <unk> .
what would be , if we <unk> not just <unk> or to allow , but even <unk> ?
so if you says , we invite you very very much , the development of this <unk> with the thing .
imagine if you ago , for instance , in the result , three up a <unk> on , they 're totally class of finding , because he you for example , your grandfather of .
and they 're a giant fan of <unk> .
then you can now just , with the world today , technology is that yes , do n't even more so hard , a <unk> do .
and that they invite the <unk> up , where it then right , and that 's really cool <unk> , the really interested in the audience <unk> will .
that means , it 's not anywhere , , but it goes straight right there , where it up to .
that really nice thing is that we the internet .
and the internet , you ca : yes , everything .
so , every medium is somehow it allows us .
that means you as viewers , you can write , drawing , turn , also , they do want .
and when we also now again this structure , look .
that looks <unk> bit of <unk> web , right ?
so this <unk> , what common set up going .
and i 'm really <unk> of that convinced that the internet was born , to pick exactly this kind of stories to tell .
it 's do , unfortunately , not so many , or at one .
so , now go , ' i but even still a step further and i 'm the audience ourselves to the players are .
which was in a <unk> .
there you can fly against the characters from the series 'd say , but also against people in the real environment , as well , <unk> on your phone .
<unk> here , you know determines , all very well , are something like mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> entertainment .
this wonderful areas , the , just very rapidly developing countries .
and the i do n't go can , because i else again , 20 minutes we need to .
we ca n't even together .
everybody 's time on of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we have the <unk> .
with this <unk> i could before the jury of the moment , i have to the short see , the <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
the have to me the price for the best <unk> given .
and i 'm going to say , these jury was from <unk> of the bank , of the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so a reasonable people , you should my .
and when i the convince you can now , here with my : the internet right to use the narrative structures revolutionize the way , the world better , i think , i can really , convince them .
so .
everybody 's time on : why is the whole , so ?
because i 've been alone in the names all areas that covered .
we have to say , first of the <unk> , who 's on , i 'm on , you 're on , everybody 's time .
now , then that die .
in the time series , is very much died .
everybody 's time on means : everyone needs to time to die .
and then of course also , everybody 's time on in terms of everyone can join , if he was that i want .
this is me totally important .
i come , from the <unk> and there 's nothing worse in my opinion , , as if it 's so a <unk> will .
i do n't know , if you know .
if you in theater , are and then comes the actor , in the auditorium and all so , oh god , please now , not me .
and that 's just not .
so it 's kind of interaction .
and nobody has to .
he can also just the viewer to be .
the reason why i took german , i 'm speaking is the , the project , the german , will be the first .
that has also a few reasons .
i 'm with this project <unk> while the way , and i was again and wondered : do that , but on english , demographic bigger , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that i can just say , the german <unk> is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , from the spanish , and then the german .
it 's now , not so , as if we 're in some small niche move .
and i think , really , if it also other people that 's like me that the people would be grateful to be for something that 's not by any <unk> <unk> , where the end , then everybody <unk> and every pun <unk> been .
if that everything that 's the way that i do it would have , about the first a result now the first <unk> <unk> online .
and if you now ask , why i because now i 'm here at a <unk> , where it , under the headline <unk> worth <unk> .
that i also a couple of thoughts .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also quite on behalf of <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also , and <unk> .
and i can really just say that this all know , incredibly important is , and incredibly <unk> .
but it uses , everything is nothing , if you 's not apply them .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just one time , all taken have , what i 'm so i 've learned .
and it applied .
and so far it 's good .
i can really just say .
so , if now , anybody thinks , i want to do , my part that , i had degrees ' a whole idea <unk> character or i ' <unk> drawing <unk> cartoon , or what 's also always , that 's also now .
you find us , the internet .
on facebook .
it , as freely given the speaker .
yes , <unk> ' i also .
welcome welcome to , you can memories are wiping out ?
question , you .
you can memories are wiping out ?
can you , because , all remember , in your life ever happen is ?
they 've still <unk> forget it ?
who has who can , still , all remember that ?
it go to do n't shake hands up .
so you can memories are wiping out ?
apparently been .
thank you .
no , so simple , we want it us today is n't do .
then i would be the talk , pretty quickly .
again good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today at night , i chose , because he had two of my passions , or my two great love right now that .
i ' , here in the near the computer , who and i ' i just with the bits and of bytes too , today that big through the world to fly .
and <unk> certain time i 'm also now as a coach , and its consultants , in private and professional field of the way .
the a side , i so with the with the computer , very much too , on the other , i 'm currently on it in the in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so how it works because that that the human beings ?
how you can because that change ?
the to a comparison <unk> .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion about an artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was : when we can , when , when we have a computer building , that works like the human brain ?
so , and i think , there are we already quite close .
so i think , so two , three hundred years , no longer need that 's not more .
but let me tell you time i do , why you that 's why that maybe <unk> bit needs .
so the comparison , between the computer on the a side and our brain on the other .
if we the computer to take , then based yes , everything , so your smartphone , your tablet , you <unk> and also these cameras and all of all of smart refrigerators somewhere on <unk> little chip .
he called , cpu , central <unk> <unk> .
these parts are put together , <unk> transistors .
the word has determines , everybody gets heard , and in <unk> it will always been so as a triangle , the .
that <unk> little device that has three <unk> and forth <unk> electricity , or not .
in our computer in our cpu , we have , i ' extra <unk> ago about five hundred million of these little parts .
and the get there 's the wild mess .
we store , things , we we can calculate the things , we had degrees ' that albert einstein 's say , listen , yes , 'n computer can all you can you can be very much , very quickly , but actually he can just zero and one that .
more he ca n't .
he 's actually quite <unk> .
we want 's time you compare with our brains .
our brain , as the smallest unit of the neuron , the neuron , and we have them , also , i <unk> , a hundred billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in our gray matter of up here in .
this beautiful but is , our our neurons have not only three of connections , but the have to <unk> a neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because it 's beautiful , is 10 trillion .
that are 10 , 14 zeroes <unk> .
so , you see , the complexity of the brain is to a higher than that , what we now , when computers .
we want to the <unk> time that , maybe the , or other people know of the first supercomputer , had their own power next door to stand , ha , were , and with the <unk> the <unk> was the campus <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> sometimes it also , but the box up here it takes about 20 watts .
and the is , and this is , the equivalent of two of bananas , so , they need not and you your calculator up there 's wonderful .
if we now <unk> giant good part up here , <unk> giant good calculator with <unk> , why we use the then not , why that we then things ?
maybe you know the , or another this out the internet , so , the person using only 10 percent of his brain , buy you now this <unk> to , <unk> brain .
and <unk> there 's wrong , the advertising , a little bit .
ten percent , yes , maybe , but our brain is yes , in the course of our evolution to this mass <unk> , that was yes <unk> smaller , in the middle here 's still our <unk> with the inside , all other , <unk> educated .
this is determines what does n't happen , because we do n't that use .
why it seems to then , that we the largest piece of <unk> let me ?
maybe you know , the term of <unk> ?
the i compared ' , and so beautiful with the iceberg , if you the iceberg see , in the sea , is , up so the top , it 's the ocean , down there 's a <unk> .
and these 10 percent up , that are that 's about this , what our <unk> , our <unk> mind is , <unk> 's but <unk> percent , it 's a giant <unk> ab , <unk> .
we <unk> the that we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> slow ♫ but we <unk> creative .
and to time <unk> on this memory back , maybe you know the , or other people with <unk> memory .
people , the , suddenly , much more detail , remember , when i do n't seen , i ' in the situation <unk> , and the tell you then <unk> , i ' said yes , but , but , where you know that ?
this is , there 's very , there 's a particular , called a <unk> , so someone with <unk> , somebody the most on a field <unk> , the excellent is , has a so good <unk> memory , it was in a plane , rubbish , in a plane , in a helicopter , so fast is , he then ow , not , over rome flew , , rome at , so rome 's yeah . ow , not necessarily the smallest city , , then , a giant of paper , put and has started to rome to draw .
and it 's not somehow , so here , the river , and there is , that , no , every single house , every single door , and every window , he once seen , he <unk> , i could he comes back to paper to bring .
how come now that ?
so why can of that , why we ca n't that , well , the <unk> is perhaps the very close the <unk> bit more access on his <unk> percent <unk> .
now we use the yes , too , but why i can i 'm going to do n't , the , the <unk> last night , remember , in all the right ?
'n <unk> <unk> of me has to it 's interesting about experiences .
he has even for instance , in the been working and has with a <unk> worked , had her experience that completely eliminated that was n't even more mind , that <unk> <unk> from the brain , that 's not happening , that 's way .
it , with it was the very well , right .
now went , but it 's the people <unk> to do .
there , you in a very safe session , the end , or after this event back , also if you ca n't even more active , remember it could , i could you then the hallmark of the car see , in the these people <unk> , that was n't <unk> , that was its feet on .
and actually is with this hallmark of the on caught .
the second what i , it was , was , he has a lady in <unk> had , has told me to your mom , and alice in wonderland read , when they 're small was , four years .
there was they 're on the one lap , your mother and your mother has been reading .
and then , he told her , in a trance , <unk> but the time ago .
then , they started to read , she was four , that happens is , they could then still ca n't read , today can you that .
and then you have said , he said , tell me , the <unk> .
they 've actually a specimen from alice in wonderland found , where right on this side of text , was , the lady , read .
the brain , so this side , so how she was <unk> , as a picture .
after that could you read .
so , we 've actually have access to , but we seem there in the normal life would say , we <unk> kind <unk> to have to us not to <unk> .
, now to store , yes , not that event , , but how <unk> have said , he has been there 's a a a picture , seen , a , a <unk> , we store , rather , our <unk> , so that , what we see that , what we 'd smell , that , what we hear that , what we taste and that , what we feel , hey , if you now <unk> , a yellow <unk> think and how they were there right <unk> <unk> , you have <unk> sense , like the taste , very popular one example .
and , it was now <unk> long tonight , put them , but <unk> comfortable to myself , ha , <unk> bit maintain and , you can i do you ask , close , but just a very short , your eyes .
and you remember , a very 're , positive event in the recent past , yeah .
take you the first , what comes .
and , if you that now do , you might notice that you to this memory of a visual part .
they get , maybe a picture , maybe even a movie ?
some drops that 's not only on , because we that normally do , but that they do for the first time of .
and if you see that , it can be , either in the film that are , from their eyes , all the experience , as you , see on a canvas .
that , we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you , they allowed to the final thought back to solve , to the eyes , again , open .
who has because a visual information , the time hand up ?
yes , go , <unk> ' a few hands up , that 's so , 'n third , i would say , yes , that 's about this , what i expected to have , it 's it 's actually something that we so often do that 's us in the first moment is n't thing .
well , do ' <unk> on .
<unk> what 's also a beautiful is , , memories , if they are memories <unk> , coming , not just this memory in high , <unk> <unk> feeling that , we <unk> a positive event , and i , the , or other smiling can see , there was so yes , that was beautiful , there were , they laugh , and already is the memory that may still there , actually store , with our memories , beautiful or other feelings .
and now it 's what 's exciting .
<unk> everything that was , well , yes , our brain power , of the no difference between what we actually remember , and the , what we just imagine , what we <unk> .
also that you can try out , if you to home <unk> down and , something in the future , imagine that still not happening is , they 're similar information , like something , if you , something i remember , in the past .
and , , you know , but it determines these stories , you , that tells us in <unk> round , of the time .
then , hey , there is that happens , and that , and this was so beautiful , and ever more these stories <unk> , <unk> beautiful , mostly the stories , hey , there were the people still a lot <unk> , there was the evening , much <unk> , there was the sunset , a lot of romantic , there was the waterfall is still much higher .
if we that already in <unk> do , so if we actually our memories so we can change , why do we that because not quite active in the question i do you ?
<unk> , when i 'm here was , has to me my uncle , a picture that , of his hut , switzerland .
a very nice image , it 's also a very beautiful hut .
just , this picture is ' <unk> bit more than the hut , so it 's artistic freedom , he told me explain , well , there is that hut <unk> bit around , there is ' 'n bit more of grass , before , there 's a beautiful dog , before , <unk> the sun moves on the alps , this is it 's a picture of hut , not to make .
and why do we that because not with our own thoughts , our own memories , hey , what it bothers me , because , when i think that 's still more beautiful do , what i there 's degree i think about ?
they 've actually the artistic liberty in their own thoughts .
<unk> you know , yes , some people , the they do you see the morning , if you just so the gray eyes have , what 's because we go ?
yes , i ' `` bad slept , i went around the <unk> through the head .
really all the night and this idea made me not more .
i think it 's around the he made the idea is n't go .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he , germany was , because his mother in <unk> stayed , and he has they just awful missed .
what the father has done , so he , every night with the son , down and has said , has asked , so , what was because the most beautiful , today 's happened ?
what was because the most beautiful , and tell time , and then , he told him to let me , it <unk> let me , it right to let me , today , great happened .
and , within two weeks went 's the son is doing .
and then it was also okay , the <unk> way is the coming , back to visit .
and the is today , has that the youth , done with the , is today , the <unk> people , i know .
it so these are not the memories , we are , in the , how we are , but it 's our focus on , our focus on the final thought we use .
and how much energy we need to waste , or use .
so if you <unk> <unk> thought <unk> or say , that was today . ow , that 's so , <unk> that practice , i but really not , you do you , but the time , like , you might tom cruise in this <unk> fiction , film , he this , this <unk> computer , where he shares his files <unk> <unk> , they do that , but also time , for you picture , <unk> have of this , well , not , so great a have to tell you , yes , well , <unk> now <unk> happens , but , <unk> the way that .
what ham , we because <unk> ' yet , ah , beautiful , look time , <unk> , that has to me <unk> ' real , like , man , that was that was beautiful , well ?
and then take you that , but the time with .
take you that , in her <unk> and you make this work .
or if you have someone <unk> 've , <unk> , that it <unk> their her head , or your wife , or her husband , <unk> , laughter , they <unk> .
so , take you also here this picture , put you <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , you make the background of horses jump , they laugh , why you laugh , you ?
because they <unk> imagine , because these kinds of fun .
and you can be much better with the situation , suddenly we deal .
ca : man memories so , ?
no , i think about our brain has been so much greater capacity , it 's all it can .
it does , but nothing , because we can free to vote , how strong , we focus , and how important , we have an event , a memory , a thought of them , it comes on us .
my plea , you , you , they play with the in your head , they use the power of your <unk> and give you him every day <unk> , their lives , enrich themselves .
yes , good afternoon .
thank you for the invitation .
if i on a party ask you 'll , what i 'm so in my spare time i do and telling , together with friends , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , i see is bright eyes and in the head of my audience the <unk> of the dancing crowds , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> up .
if i then <unk> , it , the festival , a festival , classical music is , push , ago , dancing crowds of the old people , in now , long <unk> in <unk> of sit and very focused on the art , listen .
frank <unk> once said , about music to talk is so how about architecture to dance .
and so similar to behave , that 's also , what we do .
so you yet a glimpse , which i in and i 'm speaking , i put them a short film with .
film .
<unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
this brings it from my view of the the point .
since <unk> growing the <unk> of the <unk> got out , something completely different .
we makers , are today , so forth between <unk> and the middle of the end of two decades old and have very early in our youth experienced , which is an incredible force and joy of us to classical music <unk> .
we have , but also have the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> us there some of joy , well , a little <unk> .
and we are the of belief that 's called the crisis the classical music , not , the content , so , the music , but , their <unk> is .
so imagine we the question , how do we have a <unk> create the music , the near the friends and this force over again , there , so , we so very , you like .
how do we have a <unk> organizing , that beyond the <unk> the <unk> work ?
we imagine the parameter , you from the classic concert know , space , time , light , the context , basically in the question .
take , for the relationship between the audience , and musicians .
usually , there 's between the stage and the audience a gap .
we 're trying to the <unk> .
here you a picture of our <unk> .
the musician , sitting in the audience , drink beer , and entertain , in the breaks down with the audience , stand on the play a , two pieces , put them , again in the audience .
all this is the course of the evening , a little <unk> .
everybody , like , <unk> , coming on the stage and goes back .
or that are sitting in the concert .
in the classic concert , it 's so , you on more or less comfortable , permanent chairs , like you here , sitting and after the front of look , and listening .
but there 's music , you can actually do n't sit still .
and we thought that made , as you can do that are .
if you , sit and , to a <unk> piece of music <unk> , then you and another way to .
still going to come , we in the concert does n't a stage , , but four stages the audience around .
the audience could , yes <unk> .
so i was , the night every once in the front row .
important for us is that we 're not only just any <unk> do , but that we of the music from thinking .
that we so you ask the spaces and the atmospheres around , but also in the head of the people need the music , so that can see how you to do ?
and so come then at concerts by night , <unk> at 30 in <unk> , the s 's actually just one of <unk> lit be , in clubs , on <unk> , in the old <unk> .
but not just the spaces around and the illumination can make music alive to let and now , but also the connection with other arts .
and so we are totally happy , we 've been a few years , <unk> work together , with us dances , or movement to music to <unk> develop , actually do n't need to dance been written .
and so come then <unk> for <unk> of beethoven , or for <unk> from steve , rich .
and in this year we have we have a , if you so i want to <unk> too .
we have to the first time a concert together with a <unk> implemented .
we have the story from the soldiers of <unk> <unk> with actors , dancers , <unk> and that <unk> to a <unk> together .
that has , all , that works , because we have a big <unk> had the us in this piece by .
we have about a <unk> much money from people from , germany , back , so that we into could .
all is this festival something that from a community turned out of .
we 're totally happy in the near of <unk> in the town <unk> a home found .
the city is exactly that big , we really great spaces and exciting to places for concerts find , but also , so small , we 'll notice .
if the beginning of the year in the spring , two weeks of <unk> from , europe in the city are , then drops to just on , the city , more people with <unk> around , usually .
the festival is <unk> them .
we makers , are a very colorful of students and students , doctors , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really totally totally mixed up .
and to a <unk> a <unk> <unk> , that the <unk> or a coordination , and funding in the eye you keep , <unk> , seven to 10 makers in a <unk> , for a year for a compulsory tasks are .
it 's also <unk> , but they do , for a year 's why , for the <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> in of hands are and to festival by going .
we do that all in our time and live in , germany and distributed .
that means , the part of work of <unk> and on a <unk> .

so , festival , even come and then 20 to 30 of the first to , for a few days or a few weeks of their hands are being and there to touch , where the help it 's going to the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and of course , in these 14 days to the musician .
now you could mean , so if you all of what you for so a festival needs .
but our <unk> 's still further .
we find is in <unk> the city a large community to move around us , built , the us by the what we want to do .
that 's the classic <unk> go , this is , but also about very practical things like the example of the <unk> , we have a baker , of us with the bread <unk> or a <unk> , of us , fresh food to put it .
that <unk> going in a <unk> the city , the whole year , made , and sells .
to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a whole series private found the us their living room to ask , with the musician , there samples .
and on this kind of the way that 's festival , something own in this city has become and the people in this city .
they identify , on a very special kind of the way with this festival .
since the beginning of the year , we were very much <unk> support of the citizens , place a <unk> into live out , now the entire endeavor , on a <unk> and reliable <unk> turns out .
we makers , from the stage believe that classical music <unk> , provided you come in the right hands .
so we 're incredibly happy about , in , europe , young musicians , music in your hand , and home at , in the cities <unk> hold .
if you now , still not that really can imagine , like , that feels , classical music , to see , then they come , just over .
the next year , we 're back in <unk> and we were going to us forward , if you then , there are .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you may know , acquire skills .
you know about to to learn , or the effect of learning , but i mean , to learn about it 's still much more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> .
you know , experience of time <unk> , a formula for the <unk> .
what i think of the art and culture that have , well , i can actually a lot of course , to say , because now ar <unk> <unk> i yes , in this field .
and so i thought , it may be really would , this is something <unk> called a different <unk> , to give , my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , power , but much work .
they 've now , laughter .
you get , the laughter , though the most of the saying , you know .
why is that ?
i think that has to do with that in the word or beautiful , <unk> , what we 're not that really capture .
art , that we say , sometimes , that has what .
to work we say that often , that has what .
sometimes , too .
the people , like to work , that has what for me .
but at work , we think rather , the <unk> and the art , rather , the rich , beyond the everyday , where we 're in moving , our experience to collect , our own thoughts that .
and so i mean <unk> , i do you now from want , in about three hours in five <unk> shared , all the headline have , with a i start to make it for you very simple .
it starts with the <unk> , for the childhood , goes on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth to do n't worry , is then on the word <unk> i 'm later , why i think that for my <unk> taken .
the interaction , for the first part of my professional life , and finally , five , positive identification .
<unk> of them will this is these pieces of <unk> sebastian stream , know .
<unk> , two , and <unk> .
you learn , so in the first two , three years , if you 're reasonably practices , and i 've done reasonably practiced .
and so with 10 , 11 , i have these little pieces was playing , the piano , not far from here , the <unk> , to home .
these pieces of life of a <unk> .
there 's a tune played and the different voice <unk> , but you is very differently .
the rhythm is that same , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something crucial , the art , it succeeds , and if it just two voices are , <unk> together , together to think if that the present , the future , the past , is , in works , images , in <unk> , in <unk> , the things <unk> are , the moment together , that makes the art .
and i and learned , two different melodies , sometimes , three , the <unk> <unk> , the same time to play , any of , but to hear , a <unk> , the other .
that was , what i there that have , under things .
a another experience , i 've never forget , and i 've got the concern had that 's me today , maybe , go to be .
i piano <unk> , it was still more people in the room , here today , and in the <unk> i came out .
i had it .
i brought her .
so again at the starting and , the same in i knew that again , not on .
the audience has more <unk> almost as i , because i walked in all quiet on my place , i brought my notes , put them to and the third time the beginning .
and they do n't think the me <unk> 've got behind .
but that was a very heavy .
maybe that was also a the experiences , where i then you know , well , with the piano , although i then quickly as a <unk> had , i should perhaps not my <unk> go , because , talking , you can do it easier to cheat .
yes , the next the next chapter in my <unk> i yes <unk> with the inspiration and also , i want to tell stories .
when i then , <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and told him , rather , mr. <unk> , i want to a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver , that 's not .
there must you very many <unk> visited , and very much of experience with women now .
now imagine you time ago , a <unk> young man , so , young , a sentence .
the i course not forget .
and of , i course , more adept at .
now , i was the way . '' and to time in a <unk> .
i practiced , and i remember , a situation , i 'm so never more experienced .
it was that <unk> of <unk> of chopin , and now i to the part of work , i have a in just not by , and she was with the most beautiful in , and you had the poor do , and then went into this together again , and back apart .
i can do it now , not going on play , is not a piano , here , and i could it also not more .
i have this in two decades , 30 times a row played and suddenly i came , right .
and then i do you go on playing and <unk> , i in a ecstasy played , and i know , only still , i suddenly on the quit and laughing .
i was , except me .
i did n't had to do n't have taken , and the music has this with me so .
an experience , where i learned to have , emotions , really allow us .
and sometimes it 's also really , to work , you in this <unk> <unk> , in this condition , i call it 's time , the <unk> .
where everything from ourselves .
we had this situation in fact , then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was then almost everything like of yourself , when we the <unk> did , the only two months taken , where you usually a half years , we would .
so , that was my experiences with the piano , with the artistic , with the artistic work .
and now i to my student , <unk> .
i was first , even when musicians , the way , but just as <unk> .
we have <unk> played , <unk> , <unk> .
i <unk> given , and i 've got me , so it next to my <unk> for the music and engage you can and that <unk> had .
in the choir sing , together to breathe , a <unk> sing , wonderful experience , i was very , and <unk> .
and then a point , where i as <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> gone 'm , in the <unk> and the administration , and i do that 's why do with <unk> <unk> , this chapter , because there to me this <unk> came , these this idea came , from this combination of art , culture , i was , <unk> also just in the <unk> have , politics and law a profession .
which is the art , culture to , to my <unk> to do .
so here to work for the art , but just not as artists , but , otherwise would you yes , not say <unk> , but rather than <unk> <unk> and further to do something .
i was there in theater and have to me <unk> , it was in germany , no <unk> for <unk> , just in vienna , there , i <unk> , and of , i 've always more with this is too , what you can do to art to the framework for art to improve , to a management , a good management of building ?
and this was the reason , why i then also on 'm in my professional , in towards this <unk> , and with <unk> years , i was yes , then <unk> .
but before that was a other <unk> , and this phase i yes <unk> with interactions .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my c.v , because i in <unk> born was , always there is , the <unk> oliver <unk> , about <unk> i , i have to this kind of time <unk> .
but i but a <unk> root , because my grandparents maternal were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i have the <unk> experienced .
that was me before the more something that i 'm not so the have , and suddenly i was <unk> in a different form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture , lived , of people in this in this <unk> device the <unk> .
once the <unk> on us coming , were all in a very another situation , in the very other states .
and i then with <unk> <unk> , the future <unk> and <unk> <unk> , my friend and colleague who was , we then , for the <unk> tonight , music is done , he had guitar , i piano , a other has a bass , playing , for instance , i was at her <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> done , so , but of course , on text of <unk> <unk> , months practiced .
and this <unk> , that was really from the people out .
it was my destiny , the ninth november <unk> for my <unk> learned , and i <unk> n't even with the wall fell .
i woke up the next day on , i was oral exam , oh , the wall is to like , yeah .
you have to me , quickly to come prepared , on any questions , <unk> .
and ab : there was i <unk> for the cities in the east germany .
and there , i again , experienced the interaction as social interactions of between two young german cultures .
actually talk , the same language , the music is there 's also a wonderful and was it was playing , but a lot of it was <unk> , <unk> .
different than the <unk> was n't it from the people all of ourselves , but it was a lot of the top , and that i as a big gain felt , here to see the german identity , that i later , still time back , slowly orbit broken , and the german <unk> then these two states <unk> .
since is germany , yes <unk> .
since is also the federal much more <unk> placed .
interaction , i then , but , all things here we learned and experienced , the city of food .
we have of the first place that i had the way , a <unk> , imagine if you time ago , when i 'm here 's started , <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture and spare time .
i have the still .
leisure stood for <unk> , you do n't want to write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
i was , which is the first of the <unk> .
so i play not so much so , anyway , was this wonderful , these <unk> had , but they have disappeared , soon , because i then for education in charge , and to make alliances , education do and make it could .
we have very much for the urban done , we have the if you only time that analog in between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> see , what we there that have the <unk> experience , <unk> , where you interactions between what works and architecture of can , from <unk> , <unk> , the blue stones .
many , a lot of interactions , we were and i could make and i experienced , and realized that means , if different people from different areas , a target to track .
they memorize the way , more and <unk> of the art , more and the culture , the us is the us that <unk> between people , between cultures , between those communities , better , in the view , and i come , but afterwards the art .
interaction was also then between the <unk> the subject as we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea that had to the would january <unk> , that <unk> could , the <unk> europe for .
but this last chapter , this one fifth chapter one has yet the headline identification .
this word , yes , two different meanings , , , i <unk> me with something , <unk> me so to something , and i can do it , but also as verb , use and say , i <unk> something that means , i know something .
and it always in his <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , so i say , i <unk> you , or the or this community .
and i <unk> me with something , when i have to <unk> and say , that we heard to me , , i want to identify .
and that 's a very big action .
five point three million people trying to move , <unk> cities , to identify in a double the sense , to <unk> and to realize that you a community is in europe .
as big , we have it then <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of many people , in a big <unk> life and yet , at least a common language to talk , if <unk> nations . and this was our an , the positive identification , <unk> the people and of you course , too much ride .
at the signs , the <unk> the highway , many other <unk> .
an experience of the <unk> i have not so many people around .
there to ham , <unk> <unk> and eat , two schools , worked , young girl from <unk> , of the <unk> , and boy , students from a <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , have letters of people , young men , from <unk> to a play of the home , say goodbye , love , death , the letters is written .
and it was already a special effect , young girl letters from young <unk> <unk> and boy , the russians and then the letters from young men from germany in something <unk> german .
and there she sat down , and one of these young men to the piano , and played this <unk> , i 'm so loved .
and , oh , quoting he turns out of a letter , and said , i 'm <unk> , he wrote him to home , as young german , he played , and i can never more a <unk> play , because my my two fingers , <unk> .
and he <unk> his finger , with a <unk> , sat down , back to the piano in that play on <unk> carl , and trying to the <unk> to play .
and it was him .
it was for me so a <unk> scene , after the front of into 'm , i said , what we actually learned ?
we 've learned , in the <unk> that many people together something to move , but , all things we 've learned that we <unk> years in <unk> in peace , and the culture of us that connects to do we do n't even more of the minds go , because we different languages to talk , we each identify , we 're facing us <unk> feel .
and this was for me a wonderful experience and you see , it 's going to learn not just about , something to know .
it 's going to learn , it , something to learn and <unk> to win .
and if we 're much up and invention , let , <unk> , if we do it to tolerate that we inspire and let of art and culture , our own right position to relate , in dialogue with the artwork , if we interact and finally , too , our own identity and work , by we do with art and culture of them , let , then we all won
and i hope that they still many <unk> and <unk> have , from where they those profit to .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think , we wait on the first picture that .
so i to <unk> to support my memory , here , a few slides <unk> .
it are , but no scientific slides , but it 's in my <unk> here 's why , a direction to find and me with a theme <unk> , where i think that 's going to us the next few years , significantly , are .
by the <unk> words , i know now finally , thank you for the ted , i mean , and i think , in <unk> we can this talk it to categorize them .
and then i still have heard that you the talk , in english think we should , if somehow became possible , but , if you to look , then you see , they would n't understand , what i on english to say , i did n't know , right , as i do it to say , and so i have the talk , then , but the german , left .
how we die .
i have to them there 's the first of <unk> tell .
<unk> was a patient in the hospital , in the i the <unk> <unk> , and was <unk> .
she was about <unk> , and has always like in the may , dance , because you that 's also , your guy who reminded , the first man , in war like it was then .
and so , it 's every year for the first of may , dance , went and has a dance and probably even then a <unk> <unk> to a lot had , and is then <unk> and , , here on the right side , you see that , the leg is broken , the <unk> .
a few years earlier was they also , even <unk> and i had , the same way , with equal up , , even the left leg is broken .
and then i was also , there , when physician and have experienced , for weeks on the intensive , was , with the antibiotics treated , , resurrects , and have the discussion around , as i said , is because that all of sense ?
it all the sense , at a so old people like this intense this to use to ?
so about , to <unk> , the intensive care for weeks , that 's a people at all <unk> ?
and you is then we 're cured .
five years later i the clinic , i see the name <unk> , and the can i was looking good to realize , because he just so rare is , also for the time that time , and , the dance in the may be back the other one leg is broken .
so it , the question , what <unk> i there 's actually , when i think about 'm going to a person for , decide to , what he was in his directives write , or what he also , <unk> <unk> ?
and that 's a little bit like this issue of <unk> .
you see here , then the <unk> the called the way that we die .
it 's a book out of <unk> , how we 're going to a report , the <unk>
and then it was so that the globalization , very strong that was , so you , asking , how can it because they go , connected to work ?
you , then , and that you can look in this book now , still have read , that i said , it 's a quality come , so the parts , together .
it 's a <unk> the work <unk> , it will also the work , much more <unk> be , for instance , after china , that was a big issue .
and this is then , come , in basically the work of the individual , so something to assemble , something to make , and lower <unk> was that he 's always more control it was also of the quality , he <unk> , of the accuracy .
and that , after my assessment , the people just always be less of confidence from their work to could and more and part of a little <unk> were , where it 's why was , as height of <unk> to reach , and not more about , through his work , also to define .
and if we that now to the <unk> and medical area , then there 's course , so a development .
if you in television , listen , what doctors , nurses and also <unk> the most <unk> , you 're 's the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when there must for going to what you has done , so it <unk> is to make it even paid to , and if not to document is , says the health service that i also , care or this medical treatment for we do n't .
and through this documentary , but the work of the <unk> always more <unk> and more and is this idea that you his work too , and with the use of personal belief <unk> , in the background , so a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a good friend of me is now , holland gone , because he was that 's not more to the had a <unk> practice , the abandoned and it 's in holland went to the doctor for <unk> .
the <unk> are in such developments , most of a piece of forward and he , martin , had just experienced , more and old people by between the <unk> , the hospital , to go back and , because the <unk> not more you know , what they do it should , if it the people got worse , i went .
then get the the hospital , will have restored to go back into the senior home , or <unk> , and be there on those .
and this family had , just thought , if it 's something like structured them in holland , there , i want to be there tends to train , let to something here actually , you out of this vicious cycle of <unk> and the also <unk> <unk> of people <unk> can .
there , in holland 've had he but you , after he the language with much trouble i 've had learned that there 's exactly the same thing happens , in <unk> happens .
it will also the dying is a quality introduced .
it 's not more the credibility that counts , but you put even in a freely available , i want to the example , resurrects be , or not the hospital , when i in <unk> 'm .
and then is that <unk> .
in holland , it 's so , the third days to find a conversation with the <unk> instead , and the need to then , an , i want to the hospital or i do n't want more into the hospital , when i 'm doing something happened .
right , with the , i want it resurrects , or i do n't want to resurrects be .
this data , then , a central and there is this physician , <unk> , has always the <unk> ago , and it then the decision on that basis .
if we now , <unk> back , yes , like in the may , dance , and also , <unk> was , and we imagine , have some point a directives wrote , i do n't want it resurrects be , if you this second and dance in may , in the may , where they then again <unk> is , <unk> , more to experience .
and that for my friend now , there in holland is , also very much <unk> , how he with me to .
in the last , it 's so , <unk> today about <unk> to seventy percent of people do n't even more to home to die , but in hospitals , <unk> , and that these <unk> that i also , so you can do that can perceive , not the ideals of these are for the old people , but it 's often a closely financially closely <unk> <unk> , the <unk> are often <unk> and the for , and for , this <unk> find there , after my sense , just constrained by instead .
there 's it homes , the very good about , there 's very <unk> people , the , there , those , but if i the <unk> at , and we have about <unk> patients in the year , so about five , six , perhaps from <unk> to us <unk> be , i would for me say , it 's it difficult , there , getting and be inside self-worth keep .
the whole has course <unk> reasons , that 's very clear , this whole quality , control is why we introduced , because the last the money for it 's not enough , all people optimal , and in <unk> of those are and that the people , the care deliver or the medical are so they 're paid you to say , come i well , right , i can for instance , as a nurse a family of feed with a or two children .
this is today , just not the fact , but you need two salaries , in <unk> and <unk> and mostly does it then also just .
this introduction of the quality control than a result of the time of growing the market , you regulate , you want , it , so , the of individuals .
and now i to how you , perhaps get it can , so what do we now in the last , because i yes , first of questions asked , and demonstrated , very simply is the situation for those individuals .
and there , i just one time that <unk> <unk> and the article in one of me , there <unk> , because i think , a society to have always like this structure , also a legal structure , which we all the <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> paper that one is that , would the people 's <unk> .
and the second set up there is , you to protect is to get to all <unk> .
and what i sometimes it 's missing , is still a third set in there , which every one , , the to have to , he would to protect and to defend themselves .
because that a way is , , to free from this case , i will admit that , another way , and the to me time somehow <unk> and power and then they practice , i was looking at least , no idea about doing , as i because once i 'm going to die .
because the last , it is yes , so , also if we this issue n't like to ask , we will eventually , the point , coming .
hopefully it just too late , with hundreds or <unk> .
the equivalent of my career , too , to say that wish i each and there , i want to do , care , but eventually , you , the subject to ask to , and if it then maybe so far is , or , just , if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it can already late in life to be late in life be , to say , i want to talk about this question now , even think .
if you now think about , what does mean , i would come from , will you on the dots are coming , where then the last out , what are because actually the five most important things in my life has been ?
there 's now a book , quite en <unk> is .
it are the self-esteem of course , it are then the friends , i , which i talk , and exchange can , i know , and the me through that live with , it are the <unk> .
it 's sure that trust between people , which i may also related to have , in <unk> or in <unk> area or a pastor or a <unk> or that other people , which i in the relationship <unk> .
and it are there , many of factors of course , there <unk> , i 'm the right now , not all through .
but if you , these three key points , time at , then , you have been times a whole bunch of tasks , as you , in life there may <unk> to be able to the last his own would to protect .
and then coming then still a another factor that , we have a dictatorship of <unk> experience , i did this here , as a text , or as well , as an example of that took .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior , there <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
we would you can only one of us to itself out come .
so it 's not the question , what are because others for me to do , who 's going to me because time providing to care , or , for me to use , who 's going on me to ?
but it 's exactly the other way , to ask , where i can on people <unk> , where can i put and by my inner would be having , with these questions to deal , and i was there , position and around it can .
and if you then he says , how we 're going , so this inside this quality , the us from outside , put it was , it 's a way , to say , i how to me about my my inner would , this mechanism to escape .
because no man can tell me <unk> , as i myself , because you see , and position .
and i must be there 's also do n't fit into in general <unk> or the opinions , say , you 've got now a directives out and because you 've been so old , you , ; you , if you resurrects going to , if you on a intensive want to do .
these questions , i can in the last only after a long <unk> probably <unk> edit mode .
this would the people 's a inside of posture , in me is , and the not from the outside that can be , the n't protect you can now , also a law , not , and the me , other people <unk> can and i tend to <unk> be , when i just there themselves before , which <unk> have you have , so the also to know what i for a person i 'm .
and to those conversations to lead , it takes me just spaces , and there , i think , and that i have this talk , called , and here , for , are those spaces like that <unk> in the food , that i put them here two things tried , on a picture times <unk> , spaces , where we about these subjects to think to , where a more room is , so it does n't hurt this is that 's also may not to theory is , but that a conversation , there is happening .
so we , if we then the old are , it 's say , oh yeah , a dance in the may , despite my mind may very high ages , that would still time , what .
i thank you welcome .
the beautiful good evening .
i have two things with .
if you the first part to flat , is , keep you a little <unk>
it 's still a second .
we start with the infinite .
that 's stupid , not , can take you .
what my you ?
there 's different <unk> ?
or is forever enough ?
yeah !
that 's not good , here , and this is , what 's .
so , in the fact , but i 'll it . , for the , know it .
that 's exactly how we do n't .
we are about us with just a single .
and i frontier that would like a little ab , a finite planet .
<unk> , <unk> we know , an infinite and we have a to know .
and it 's for the <unk> to the magnitude of vast amounts .
if we in a finite way that are , and the two <unk> , in the one example , chairs , in the other people .
we know , , now , we look in the box in the number is small , it are three , chairs and it are three people .
we can we will , whether in each of the same number of elements in there is ?
count , how would we do it ?
that means , we would just the people <unk> , one , two , three we get the three , we count the chairs , see three , chairs , one , two , three three and three three is three , and wonderful .
that my you , yeah ?
very beautiful .
this works in a finite wonderful , that works , at large numbers , though it <unk> .
but it does .
how do you , counting ?
how you can still going to check , so many people like your chairs , there are ?
i 'm aware , chairs and people were taken and not what else .
<unk> let me !
you 're called the mating .
you very well , that this is , not , now we 're in life the way , and understand that all .
not that 's very beautiful .
so , you call that 's also a professional a <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
you take a , of you on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> the way , the next <unk> , everything is them , different people get different chairs , not a chair there is abandoned and the amount of these are the same size , okay ?
now we go into the infinity .
how do we have two infinite amount of each other that ?
we would say , a is that big or bigger or smaller than the other .
we could we do it ?
we were going back to .
right , that 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite long lot to count , yes , i 'd time just say , you get not to another .
<unk> , forever , is , <unk> ?
so , how about it ?
madame ?
no way , madame !
they had this , but that really started .
they mate .
so , now we 're going to look at the time .
we estimate , appreciate is in an always bad , yeah ?
you see , you see , no end , yeah ?
the point is what , you do it very simple .
if i for the <unk> take the natural numbers , <unk> , we computer scientist who need the zero , the beginning , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we have to say , , a copy of this <unk> and take out of this exact replica , the infinity in many <unk> numbers .
left to the just numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all straight numbers are <unk> the infinity long band of natural numbers , but the a band , lack of the <unk> , the other people are the straight and the <unk> on , okay ?
we call the a lot , g , straight to pay , we call the other kinds of n , the natural numbers .
what you think ?
this is , g powerful , it 's bigger than n , the same size or smaller ?
same size ?
this is , but very <unk> , yes , in the a lack of yes , the <unk> .
who 's a different estimate . '' ?
smaller ?
who says , bigger ?
ah , the , yes , really do n't plan , yeah ?
that ca : yes , not be , yeah ?
you can yes , not , where what 's missing , bigger , that 's not , <unk> ?
okay , they say , smaller ?
you would assume , not ?
this is the conventional , what you suspected , of course , is wrong .
and now , and now i 'm , why the amount of the same .
how does it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the straight to a lot , we take the zero from the natural causes of , mate , out .
the next one of zero , plus two 's two , after the zero from the one , and i 'll get back a <unk> .
the four , the two , six , the three , eight , four , yeah ?
you can that 's also turn , it 's doubling , this is , <unk> ?
and completely clear that is , by the <unk> do we make it that i do it always in the lecture that 's a <unk> <unk> .
and here , one , there are just the straight on the band is in a long , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural on the straight , <unk> , the <unk> are the way , and the band is still in a long .
that 's just in an .
so if you some to what we have today i learned to have the infinity learned , yes , what 's because it forever , i know , just finally ?
an infinite amount of has a property , there 's in a finite just not and this is , is an absolute <unk> , a real subset of the right that big .
that do you in a finite not , if you from three three people are two people <unk> , it 's only still a there and that was a 's three .
yes , so we 've infinity .
it 's none <unk> ?
okay .
then we do it 's still a second part of the odds .

i here what brought .
at this experiment i 'm sure , it at least a third , and <unk> it does anybody with , that it has , yeah ?
so , we call the doors , a boca , b , c .
i 've got behind anything hidden , i hope , you has a 's not heard .
and they should now , first guess .
where , my you , i have something hidden , behind a boca , b , or c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
you appreciate the c .
who has , another idea ?
a , ?
who still has an idea ?
'm going to <unk> , b has been missing , not , otherwise you hear the yes , never going on , <unk> ?
so it 's right .
it 's really completely different matter , so they have to do n't mean , the three of letters to fall and i 'm looking for me a .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it is yes , completely clear , because the chance you to time you 're lucky to have , is yes time just at a third .
<unk> , there 's three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i doing this , i just a on .
well , i know of course , where it 's up .
<unk> , that , here somebody , <unk> .
so , i know , where it 's up , and that i guess , and the value , or how we also , you do it 's called , is in a second round .
so i 'm now , the game <unk> i now it now only <unk> .
so it 's so , we go in a second round .
now , , i <unk> me on that a boca , <unk> ?
so , now i have to a door to show up behind the n't it 's and the they do n't have said .
because , if you now , b to say , and i say , and i know , it is yes , not the b .
then there 's yes , not a second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , of luck had .
but i have to yes , that 's <unk> , in the second round to go .
so i can just a wide open , behind the it 's not just not is , but what they also do n't have said .

you can now , a to stay , i necessarily a , on .
i do now that on , what they have to .
or they say , i do , c .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with that you know more likely to become ?
phew , very beautiful , b is on , now i know , it 's behind , c .
or , but , god was very much , b , open been is , i always looking at a to stay , this is it .
or would you now say , is , <unk> , we have , <unk> the way , so , we 've only still two doors , now it 's no matter , to change , or to stay .
what my you ?
it 's not matter .
<unk> .
why is it does n't matter ?
very beautiful .
why it 's why is it <unk> ?
yes , right , that 's wrong .
that does yes , almost , as if we do it yesterday <unk> have , <unk> ?
but that are you , <unk> , are a new no , fun .
so , here , the thing is very <unk> , yeah .
understand that all sorts between , i do n't , six and , yes , i ca n't <unk> years , else can i same , not more coming up , <unk> ?
so , it '' really , everybody .
behind this door is it to a third .
and it 's always just to a third behind a door .
you can guess , what they want , they have with two thirds are you in the dirt .
that means , they can on two doors to guess , not that you ca : yes , at <unk> do , you can yes , two dozen put them , you 're it , <unk> , if you the zero , <unk> , that 's yes , everything in real life .
but here we 've just a door .
so , now is this , two thirds of it 's not , what you guess .
so it 's the two thirds of here , but it can now , but just behind a door to be .
behind the is a 's not !
so , what is then more likely ?
no way , i 's really quite hidden away .
so , what is now more likely ?
it 's better , to stay , or to change ?
now it 's just , yeah ?
yes , of course .
so , that was now not hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
they have any luck had .
why ?
very simple , also have two thirds are not a hundred percent , the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope , it was for every what .
thank you .
mr. <unk> you to me , jamie oliver <unk> , here , of bad diet and bad food and overweight people who covered , this depressed , yes , completely .
but i <unk> , my best , that after all back the way is , those impressions .
i come , which of <unk> farm , and i knew , until i 12 was actually not a mcdonald 's .
that , time , who , right .
, yeah .
thank you very much for the invitation today .
i 'm here in the close up .
and i 'm not to mr. <unk> , so on it came to me to ask , if i the ted , the lake up to and over a particular topic want to talk .
i told me <unk> <unk> : this issue .
, motivation is also not bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> , the has said , maybe the power of a or another afterwards , sports .
about i also full of this .
so today at night at the rain , jogging to be now <unk> much in order , but i have to the morning in the fact , training , because i in three weeks , <unk> june , <unk> , of <unk> to oslo to go to deal with <unk> bike , that are <unk> miles .
go to me remains the morning , the rain this training do n't <unk> .
so who 's a ride to , <unk> , about this morning , early on , in <unk> , i <unk> ' they all welcome .
i ' degrees , i said , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> about this issue .
and i ' i started to get , with the subject <unk> .
do n't worry , this beautiful , little <unk> , the blind faith to come up afterwards <unk> .
i , before me just thought about it did , when i <unk> 'm going to describe what i the where i <unk> ?
so , i come from <unk> village with six houses , you <unk> , some <unk> and at my parents the farm there 's an apple apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what makes you from <unk> , beer .
trust , in sports , of course not in <unk> but at me , <unk> and beer .
why would tell ' i the story , where i 'm from ?
for me is a the very important stories that i really , right from the country , the village , come , and there was raised 'm with two big brothers , with the oldest brother , the <unk> is .
and with the second half brother , just blind is how i .
it means , like bright and dark , can see how i just also see , where <unk> window in the room , whether it light , is , or from .
what today , very practical , is for the <unk> .
the , we both can just see , when i 'm going on us anything .
'n <unk> , but i say , and i ca n't tell , is <unk> man <unk> <unk> .
the relation to talk about the old men , <unk> .
and to go <unk> .
and what for me , but always , it was , is of course , the fact , as i wrote , you trust and get that this big trust , that <unk> that we all need to <unk> as something <unk> situation , say , i time .
and the was for my parents definitely , how many of them , , my brother and i still not blind people knew .
we were so the first , then is a sudden in their lives <unk> .
and then they had to from the situation of what do .
and , now <unk> i , it 's a giant lucky , my parents than farmers are not all the day long time had to us to stand and us , the hand to or to say , there 's <unk> wall , <unk> you , along and you can then <unk> feel , where you <unk> .
a , that would be awkward been -- we have a home so <unk> .
and b , ham , our parents of the beginning of us to that encouraged , and then to go , where we also our sighted brother is .
so , in your home alone <unk> , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , it also time we risk .
there has the blind brother me then with <unk> <unk> <unk> courtyard , pushed <unk> used in .
the <unk> the <unk> i until today still .
so this is that with the big brothers -- the 're not only good for the elbow , but also for the <unk> .
and our brothers and and my brothers and i we ham the <unk> farm that really so all the outside did , ma , that could do , , especially for bicycle , drive .
and that has the <unk> brother , with the desire started with three years , and then we wanted to say , also -- michael and i .
and have then started , with <unk> to drive , how to many little kids , today with the wheel is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can .
but we have that , i started with <unk> , some without .
and then is the big question : how to be ma , there ?
and how to get you that trust , one that trust the parents , the children , eventually brought back from the bicycle <unk> and <unk> and other thing that trust of us , we 're not permanently , where it go .
and our solution was , we course , a , of our parents tell us have to let , where are the <unk> , so where is a car , where <unk> followers , where are perhaps also time , any <unk> things , i realized that -- the turns out you now , not the way -- there we knew , so they are .
and we had to us in between orient to us that one hand , and you , but the other hand , listen .
and that you can now in here , not all of testing , because otherwise it 's here , according to you do n't more of them .
but <unk> ' evening when they have time , light up and , in her bedroom or in whose bedroom , and then they orient to .
you can time trying to just <unk> <unk> with the tongue , so , to orient and they will find that 's at us people as well , bats are also -- they 're a resistance .
so how the bats , so with <unk> will also you hear , now <unk> wall , <unk> resistance , because the sound that 's different <unk> will .
and this is for me in trust , so trust , in the movement , always very important .
but <unk> as high <unk> to have and the safety , i ' <unk> chance to me , there <unk> piece to help .
and i just to orient no big trouble and , also , many accidents , the , or another there 's the course , .
what i , today , no pictures , i ' , that i 'm very <unk> itself is , from a our <unk> , as children .
which is the climb on our higher building on <unk> farm .
i , here is written , the confidence , it also by a <unk> diversity .
and that my goodness ' i 've been very literally , because i was a man , the , much , later in <unk> and in the <unk> with the trust the scientific side with i ' , i 'm about a thing i never yes , or i 've never that stumbled out how i do it ourselves , experienced .
i , the never been so that may also to drastically read .
now , but it determines , to do with that 's lots of course not everybody so , experimentally to experience .
the diversity is the figure of our strengths with the <unk> to some point to know , where i a good , what i talent and where i can just my strengths , also full <unk> ?
and our brother , that again , the , michael and i always took on the roofs off the house .
so , then , okay , we ham 's a <unk> .
there you anywhere from <unk> window <unk> of the <unk> for example .
and the johannes went and then <unk> , michael afterwards , and i , probably already still <unk> bit like the girl playing , <unk> <unk> , i do n't .
but the last end , who stays like the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i think , the others , we 're yes , the generation of young women , here , also not .
and of so i <unk> then , always with .
and then i was <unk> the consequence that we look at all three <unk> <unk> up sitting and the dad with <unk> followers , <unk> <unk> <unk> and do n't even more you know , what he now , say to .
because of trust is , then the way , when others doubt .
have the father so , to god 's sake , help to help to help , about , the danger is the size been , one of us , too afraid <unk> , and in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i do n't -- somehow <unk> would be .
is , but never happened .
he had , then , so <unk> that he 's us that , again , slowly <unk> , or by johannes <unk> , of us , then returned .
and that was ' i for me very great , we these options .
but , do n't worry , this is not <unk> , not necessary to later <unk> to do .
for me were the different <unk> , in my life and more important were , all , interesting .
and , all , they were all for <unk> , because i just also see it could , where i ' i 'm so my borders , what are perhaps , so my <unk> .
so to <unk> good <unk> i would have never can be .
that i had never the <unk> .
and i go , until today is n't like in <unk> .
i go , until today i 'd go out in the rain .
now , not at five degrees , like the moment .
and at <unk> rain , but yet , rather than the inside .
but i ' , for me so this faith in my strengths with being discovered that i different <unk> one i .
as the first example , <unk> .
and this was for me very beautiful , because there 's also the coach , of us in <unk> had , has said , ok , we have it 's noisy <unk> children , but they send it ' us <unk> couple of the blind children .
actually about it , yeah well , because there 's the pack , you , anyway , each of coats .
and then notice that you , what the other people power .
and there was always been so my big trust , of course , when i the competition for many of 'm going 's hard , because then you can the others may yet , what do , what i do n't <unk> .
so there 's just a way , and that 's a faith in my speed .
the other into a foot in the <unk> imagine , i find ourselves backwards fall , let the <unk> head to look and then it 's because he goes back and the competition is over , because it 's the full score , there .
i 'll do it 's not try out .
i had it , i thought , but <unk> .
i think , that 's now <unk> bit risky .
and that i also here to do n't have volunteers , right ?
<unk> .
crap , i <unk> ' .
okay .
the next for me that was a sport during the school that then the <unk> and that <unk> .
my parents were home or are until today <unk> and that you have to us , taught me as children .
but for me was always in the school <unk> clear that matters : how can i as much , after the school to move to my excess energy getting rid of ?
and there was i then as a way in the school <unk> to do .
and although i actually always thought , that 's all , ' <unk> boring , because <unk> is something for the <unk> rather , <unk> ' i .
i found , i used -- <unk> ' i am today , not more .
i then eventually , well , i do with the <unk> .
and i , then that first time , man , again , is the great diversity here in the sport , because you <unk> need , you need power , <unk> good coordination , and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- you 've probably a lot of it 's also from their work recognized ?
exactly that 's also in <unk> .
you will only then quickly , if you just the full of trust in the your technology .
if you that trust in the own power has -- so the power , you the that , then , every other conditions , the bad weather , the soft snow , the <unk> snow , the skiing , can .
and if you in my case that , faith in the team has .
because when <unk> , nothing like , i a course <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and me is still never that <unk> happens like today -- i have to the word to use -- my <unk> -- there 's and yes , just a -- has now , even my exercise .
it , but nothing , we do you yet again .
or i <unk> , you now maybe just one time .
do with a , a , of them later still a different exercise .
what i find is always do the subject <unk> trust , is the exercise , the listener , just imagine , i 'll see how it is so , if you do n't see that <unk> to make and with its <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> yes , so , you has two sticks in the hand .
of so , , i ' i was no one hand , more free , else could i yes , my goodness ' <unk> take and myself , the <unk> <unk> .
not about .
so i have to me different helping .
i then my <unk> and the years ago , i 'm going .
and the explain me with the voice of the way .
so the to just always the exact <unk> do .
and also that 's important for trust .
the precision somewhere in the communications , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tells me just always <unk> , if it <unk> about , tells me <unk> and <unk> , the says , then , left on the 11 , i know it 's easy to left , so the upper part of <unk> at with the pointer .
when he says , left on top 10 bit <unk> after the left , and when he says , right on a decade .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem , because then i have to again <unk> or he has to me again , correct , i know , , now is what do n't .
and for me is yes , the very large , critical , if the <unk> , i 'm going , i have to the really completely <unk> to 's time , negative to say .
to 's positive , to say , he 's for me that tool that 's me to , just really then quickly to be , and in <unk> , faster than others , in the competition to start .
and that i can only , when i 's just do , with both arms to me <unk> , i <unk> , on a leg , to stand and i must now , the eyes to make -- ha ha , or they can also open , let me , which brings , yeah .
and must then just so <unk> and must then on the other one leg and the same way back to stand and you can not here <unk> bit of balance , but to actually more quiet .
also with high shoes .
yes , and this is for me that very key , when i the <unk> 'm just : how <unk> i do it , the guy to say , so i tell the guy , because i actually just men as <unk> had , as i 'm able to do it , just to say , hey , you 've got me the right <unk> do , because the , the see , ourselves .
the know , not , what he tell me to .
so i 'm one , the him the way to communication , just open to .
and that 's like in any <unk> .
if anyone in my needs n't know , he can tell me , do n't help , but there , i 'm just wondered , and to say : well , i need , of you the curve , maybe <unk> <unk> used to <unk> .
or i need , of you like now , walking , you me that i also time she says , how long , the mountain , is , because if we the <unk> <unk> , you think , some time : now , it must , but over to be .
and kick it again and how <unk> and the thing you hear , just not on .
and there to practice , i then , also time the pilot , as it 's the walking is , on <unk> <unk> forward , i then he says , we have unfortunately only 20 minutes left behind us , we may -- so we ham the other times <unk> minutes to -- then we 're 's <unk> but again , rather <unk> .
of why is that for me , important , there 's also the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
i listen , ' <unk> -- here 's probably another , also <unk> <unk> drive ?
who , and more ?
so my best thing was time , times faster , but that was in september , and now , so in april , may , i 's honest , i said , never been so much faster than done as <unk> .
and the <unk> the moment , <unk> .
and for me , , are these <unk> <unk> only then as possible , when i just mean your ears , frankly , i .
the other me that , exactly explain , what he goes to , looks and i 'm so the way , there , my risk perfect , estimate .
and this is for me , the very important stuff , why i say , trust is more training and not this <unk> <unk> .
so <unk> ' of them as a blind , now , not so much , i said -- from <unk> .
because i also , that experience that had to me a <unk> right , and left is wrong <unk> had .
and then i was that in the competition that time , bad , because it 's next to the way , three feet <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet just <unk> .
of so -- , that was -- of course <unk> on .
that i also , because the <unk> to , yes , around , to , so <unk> <unk> .
and i 'm going on it today still be permanently , i people say , left and say , then , <unk> , the other left .
so i was then , right , unfortunately .
power in life often not so much .
but , in <unk> situation with pressure , that you probably also all of the work or the university , like , and if it 's time quickly go to .
then is , precision , yes <unk> <unk> hard challenge .
but for me , , which means <unk> trust that , everything that i the risks we know .
and there , i must be honest , say , i am when someone , not see , relatively size of the advantage , because i <unk> , my risk in many ways .
so the <unk> <unk> ' i now , quite all .
the driving <unk> tree , from falling slope , down <unk> , i know , and i <unk> ' but of course -- and this is yes , that important -- i <unk> ' , the good pages .
the which then also , can be , if that trust that there is .
and if you have someone had found , the just really , a hundred percent of so <unk> , as i 's just need .
and , i , all , these goals , i .
because this is for me in the subject of trust that the next , very key thing .
you need the goal and i have to just really also clear to be , what does it because , trust , go ?
because of this is often <unk> faster the term , you time .
i trust , or the or me about ourselves .
but the very key thing is yes , that it , too much on .
that you for that you for trust a lot <unk> .
and that you yes , too -- because we people all with <unk> <unk> <unk> meet -- we want <unk> sense that .
and the sense , is very often , we just also create , 'n target them together to achieve .
that we do it 's make -- in my case for example -- from some , weeks i ' i am i the <unk> gone .
and there <unk> ' i right , i have to me now , anybody looking , the or the i in the case that trust , that i just this mountain , up <unk> .
and how do you , then , you look at the mountain , some really up there 's right ?
well , i had to say , the giant advantage , i , some things going to do n't around , if it for instance , next to me a hundred meters <unk> .
and then i was me that is <unk> .
ca <unk> advantage to be , is heights , which is no problem .
and i ' , and , of heights worked , now , regardless of the <unk> i am . '' and to time , i ' i then that made <unk> <unk> or i 'm in berlin <unk> flew , there will you with <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
this is already <unk> bit <unk> , if you then up there is , and down the cars can hear , then you have to still not a lot to see , there to know , now it does it hurts , when i <unk> .
and those things are for me and more interesting .
, to also the <unk> to have , but to just also to know , hey , i war , the to myself , i there are so yes , focus , <unk> and you can just by but also <unk> new new experience .
and that 's exactly <unk> <unk> bit of the <unk> , because at <unk> mountain <unk> yes , so , you about every day , 10 hours ago , to and it 's some of just still get
you go and goes and has only still rocks to , around , and less plants .
you take the <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun of years ago <unk> first world war and has .
so if you <unk> <unk> see , is the <unk> about the last the <unk> .
the about , so that the only exciting .
we have the <unk> just from the distance , or the other that .
of so <unk> ' i there <unk> a faith in the <unk> -- despite his silly <unk> , he and i had .
because i thought i ' : well , so , as i said , there <unk> ' i probably even faster the way , how to the thing <unk> .
but , it 's otherwise , quite <unk> , because you <unk> to <unk> actually now not that really much change .
and really exciting is that 's and then , yes , something hard to .
so if you then in the <unk> and the air thinner .
or if it comes next to a <unk> , if you then <unk> little <unk> , where it 's left and the right <unk> .
then it 's particularly beautiful and if it 's and then also still accounting night is , and all with <unk> <unk> , has at us the <unk> , sometimes it also , now would he told me to be the wire just take , so he then i also really in the view , and the grip .
because i as the only without <unk> there <unk> and this was him , but sometimes to risky .
trust , we did it is that i just said , i : well , i can kind of my she , my friend , and it was , a hundred percent of trust , i <unk> ' , and we have this before , well <unk> .
but i need , also <unk> form of security , so i 'm not permanently , focus to , because , can you imagine , if you look at the mountain in the time , <unk> stone , right , right on one , left on the 11 .
there will you look at some <unk> , and it all .
so it 's for us , faith in the case been , we 're <unk> connection , so ham , we have a rope , your backpack attached that i had in the hand , and i 'm then behind her , of loosely <unk> rope gone .
i had in the other <unk> <unk> , i also with <unk> bit of the height of the stairs time i .
and you is then eventually , only still , with the foot <unk> stone had or , with her <unk> <unk> stone <unk> , that i also have already know , so on me coming and i 'm not permanently just focus had .
and what i realize that all that really has shown , how beautiful it 's actually , if you course , then eventually , there the top of get that you just this goal really so again in the corner near , -- just like , the <unk> , with the <unk> .
other thing is it , but also , that i realized i ' , trust , in me , i ' that is ' <unk> just , when i now , really <unk> goal , i , like that the top .
but that trust is also in other , the <unk> , like trust that works .
when we then at night that the mountain <unk> are , we were in the group , mostly , in front and behind us are the other seven participants did and the were always be relatively dense behind us and it has to everyone can pause it was a different from behind us and i 've been thinking : tell ' time , why would remain , because why we 're looking , because , everybody that he 's there behind us run it can ?
at night , you can also the girls not from the back to look .
that 's kind of not the reason to .
and then i ' i some time , oh yeah , , their faith in their skills is degrees , some pretty <unk> .
you go there at night by the dark , you go to 12 clock on , then the first of no light .
this is totally <unk> , if you <unk> is the air is being thin , so actually only still <unk> and now , not more <unk> first .
and then come , but eventually , the moment , where the <unk> have said : yeah , man , that was actually , practical , behind you to go , because the friend of me , i just all explained , we 've always <unk> -- like that women <unk> so do .
have all the night of us anything about and the other in the group , right there that , the recognition , <unk> to know , ok , it 's now just <unk> hour , that , they told me then told .
or i do you what 's very different now not from the mountain was telling .
and that 's exactly to know , it 's still have someone , the it may also just bad about <unk> about that we may time talking -- it are only still <unk> hour , the sun 's going on .
right now these things , this also used mirrors from the outside can trust , again , significantly increase and you can just to contribute , you so the personal gold that i also be achieved .
and for me is trust , all , then given and is , all , then the perfect , when i just so the personal gold and that , just really do n't want , then eventually , in the idea of the right there is .
that 's one of course , in in sports , with the gold , in that you so <unk> -- i actually also not , why that an do -- maybe , i did n't want to the value to test , or to look , whether it , just to lead <unk> is ?
so i think , at some medals it 's so , in vancouver , were six grams a hard .
if that all real gold would , <unk> i 'm not here , if i the <unk> , think i .
or at least in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but , i think , the real , why you that does , is more , you , can imagine : what i ' i actually degrees are created and as i mean , skills and forces focused on a point .
how i ' i in me in my skills , but of course , in the team , that we all need , whatever , whether in studying , in the job in which is also always .
anyway , whether an old man or young woman , we need that people , also in the we trust .
and if we then this goal in the head clear , eyes , and that 's also , have , is that the best of evidence that we look at least in a project in our lives of trust could .
and if you , once you can , you can do it 's also , definitely in other areas .
thank you very much
a science for me , is the title of my talk , that is , <unk> your nice maps .
what i 'm driving , is the very <unk> effort , the sciences , again as something <unk> in the general population to attach .
in basically , and i could be satisfied .
if i in a <unk> <unk> , there 's all <unk> only with the literature to scientific issues , the <unk> <unk> is .
even everybody <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where the scientific issues , <unk> issues , somehow , which the will .
every station has at least a <unk> , where i kind of scientific paper about data .
, that 's totally <unk> , if you look , what it , magazines and <unk> for children there with scientific issues .
every program has somehow , a own <unk> in <unk> , but still is that a pure <unk> story .
science is a thing , the can i 'd like at the can i 'd like reading , but that that 's me , not themselves .
cool , is cool science just kind , at csi , in breaking bath , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , <unk> ?
at csi so a <unk> five minutes , you do anything with the reality to do , but that 's cool , <unk> ?
there , i can see me to identify .
big bang theory , i can about laughter , i understand the jokes , not , but it 's great .
this is extremely too .
because , that 's kind of a paradox , the future will only we manage can with these technological issues and issues .
but at bay , that none for , .
i 've got a few little examples of time <unk> , like science , or science , just at us , a given .
a very <unk> example , in london , you have a tower being built , <unk> , the architect , time , not so now , we build this time somehow , so <unk> .
what happens is , right now , the sunlight from up in this facade into , i did that time <unk> out , focused on and then , somewhere in other , you , a point <unk> .
that was the size by the press , there was , just a jaguar .
too , the heat , so <unk> , this poor <unk> , really long , long saved , there are the <unk> time .
there to ask you , so an architect , the n't actually somehow , a bit of what in physics have learned , because i mean , is yes , completely new , so a mirror , things focused on .
so , what i found have , new , is <unk> , somehow <unk> ago , the christ , where he was supposedly , are a fleet an .
there 's the question i really , what has the more design or an architect , or where , he studied ?
this is now a very <unk> example .
a classic , which is given such are topics have , is also the <unk> .
<unk> , this is now , a few years ago , when that just sort of the media was .
there was the train , <unk> , because <unk> changed the plants , that was on once a danger .
genes that was <unk> with green <unk> .
genes that were kind of what <unk> .
<unk> , oh , there are gene inside .
there 's situations , where the market , farmers , really become have : hey , i <unk> vegetables .
no idea what that should be , yeah .
so , yes , okay , dutch tomatoes , we can about discussing .
but to the time i was in the lab , active in and was eventually , frustrated , because i tried to have , those evil genes in my bacteria <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came to home , and my then neighbor , <unk> , you see , but not happy , what 's because we go ?
i like this : yeah , i try there 's been three days , so a little gene in my bacteria to transform and that 's how do n't .
that was , what i tried to have to to explain , so somehow a <unk> , the genes , i thought , yes , does the good that lady , when i of genes 'm going to know you , what she says .
that was , what i actually meant , so a particular sequence , i got there in this <unk> <unk> bring to .
but that was what the woman has seen .
this woman , i never again , the hand shook it !
who knows , what i do you <unk> , <unk> ?
genes is what 's very <unk> .
this is now , well , 10 years ago , and yet , that somehow , in consciousness ones .
genes , this is at what <unk> .
<unk> i quite a long did n't even more read .
it 's then , gene and technology , free , and it , but really in our language <unk> that .
<unk> not allowed to europe , was a headline .
<unk> different , a lot of other , corn , yes , does not genes that contains .
a different headline to <unk> , rats to die .
yes , that was also a headline .
the are , but not so old and it 's also be relatively easy matter , on what level , i be ways .
anyway , whether the time , or the picture , all talk from <unk> .
, it 's still not <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm afraid that it also not more time .
but that shows you just the insecurity in the population , there , because they simply not with the issues going .
nevertheless , we in our future of us with these technologies are .
now i was just <unk> , nobody had the size of the subject , but it be about things to and one , what the most really no idea .
and this is pretty sad .
how it 's actually looking at all this information from the lab in the population ?
if we assume , this little , boy , motivated scientists are sitting in his lab , has an experiment , <unk> anything , beautiful and well , and he goes down think , man , this is yet , what that interested , but the public .
then to the first , the professor , go .
the head , decides then , okay , cool topic , of his name on it as <unk> , that 's always important in the science , <unk> be .
good idea , i still not in the public , it 's , a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> think , oh , great idea , class , we make a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , we have a <unk> with a project , a nice idea , and that 's coming then sort of them out of ivory tower .
that will then <unk> , yes , but , who really ?
now are those institute 's rarely alone , usually have multiple <unk> so a common of , a common <unk> .
and of all these are then the <unk> , really cool projects , then over the <unk> , the magazine had been , the <unk> , no matter whether it leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
this is the way .
the basis , it will always on filtered , in ivory up until the really , really cool experiments , then , really to speak projects , there in these <unk> up .
that are quality able magazine , are really well done , there 's of all there 's free , yes , but who <unk> i do with ?
in basically took only the , the , for interest .
in the <unk> we call that always the <unk> the <unk> .
so the , the , anyway , that interested in the <unk> then , the newspaper , yes , beautiful and good .
a magazine , reached the audience , the , for interest , and the maybe about an idea that have , where <unk> it 's even in these articles .
who <unk> ' i , but really ?
the <unk> the it anyway .
the way , that was now , the otto <unk> , i call him , mr. <unk> <unk> , under the circumstances , other publications reading , i tried , it neutral to keep the <unk> i 'm going to do n't really .
yet , again , our future will we just sort of coming , if we with these <unk> are .
fracking , <unk> , renewables , <unk> , that are all about the <unk> are the gentleman <unk> but not really understand , and over the he somehow vote to .
my project , my idea is therefore , different <unk> , this little , young , get a scientist out of ivory to take , really completely from its regular <unk> to separate , and he was there a course , to give , a seminar , as you do science , which communicates .
what is mostly what happens to a scientist , so i have a buddy , we know that we had been good about 20 years , he 's <unk> , it 's at us a <unk> rule , it 's not after his job to ask .
once he the mouth <unk> and over his career telling , he told us <unk> .
<unk> , that are scientists , tell you then , what of <unk> .
<unk> , it sounds , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> is already nearly so the same level as the genes .
<unk> treated , that 's kind of , oh , you do n't know , what is .
the really teach them to pass one time on , that 's beautiful and well , if you on a conference you and there your people , your <unk> , on <unk> anything to tell you want , you can you 'd like of <unk> tell , bleeding , time , say , just water .
where is the problem , it really <unk> and normal to talk ?
i school , that 's my idea , these young scientist , still not so far in the hierarchy <unk> are , still a little more malleable are the school , i , as you really makes .
that has for all of a use , <unk> , anyway , and investors , we want to also know , there in the <unk> happens .
eventually are that 's also by the there to be used , so the need to , actually also the <unk> communicate .
but the these training , that 's just a story .
i want you then also really , a jury , sit and the to your project , imagine , your project a jury , <unk> , <unk> , honest , even worse 's not , children .
there 's a quote , i do n't know if that is real , of albert einstein , if you do it 's not just tell you can , then you touch it does n't really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab to take and your project really to rethink , how can i think that really quite normal , which we communicate ?
so stories that 's already several .
<unk> are totally modern , is everywhere , in , everyone at the common , but also there <unk> i in basically took only once again , the <unk> .
who <unk> because , <unk> the city in the university , some sunday morning , up , there a talk to <unk> times . '' ?
these are the , it anyway .
there , i 've got back to my <unk> .
so , are the people , the , anyway , for interest , there , drive and , there , one talks sound .
this is beautiful , there are any <unk> done , all these are satisfied , all these are happy to go to home and this is it .
so down , i still on a second aspect to say , it is not in <unk> the project .
these scientists are also , trained , like <unk> actually children ?
because many really <unk> have , on the essential to reduce .
because scientists , like the research , and as kids in their world , exploring , is identical .
kids to work , extremely scientifically .
they do anything like to learn from the walk .
they try to what , it work ?
<unk> , fall to the way to do n't work , next iteration , i change a parameter , do it 's still time a new .
children learn from extremely scientifically .
that are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> , what happens , which factors i change to , it works or not .
this is normal .
but that have a lot <unk> .
and of so i think , really work , the only , after the <unk> of and these scientists had permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the kids from the kindergarten , from the primary school , there in experiments that make the children , on their <unk> , and , there really matter to engage with , because i 'm convinced i 'm going to the children and the scientists , in basically took the same language .
and then you can perhaps , maybe some point , that 's my hope to tell the kids that then also at home , and then <unk> i also a gentleman <unk> , the , then also on , for scientific subjects were interested , because the children with him that tell .
this is then not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not anywhere , galileo , but his kids to tell him , something that it <unk> mirror , with a <unk> worked , that it , a bread <unk> , that 's there on paper <unk> , and understand then , and shaking and then perhaps also the head , as an architect , a house can build .
and not just <unk> i then , mr. <unk> , but also the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it now , that the first <unk> , i 'd have to have said , yes , no way , so , <unk> for our scientists , that this is just not subject , have just other priorities .
a scientist to yes , not to communicate .
yes , i think i then , okay , then she calls i the next .
but who somehow , in a at work , <unk> is in a company , anyway , there 's in the next break .
thank you .
i a crazy , is the question .
and fly you can also not every day .
the last few weeks ago were terrible .
the weather , us a big is through the calculation .
ago , seven , soon after eight years , i asked been , if i 'm here that are going to .
i was before the ceo , almost 10 years , the <unk> <unk> in munich , and in <unk> .
we 're there are quite far , the top has come .
they had <unk> as a client .
and for me that was actually more , well , this is , <unk> .
what is that really ?
<unk> , that 's actually a ridiculous .
i then , but you know that , who behind it 's and that i stand here today .
and yes , maybe it 's a little nuts , but it is , , too high , emotionally .
it 's beautiful and always exciting and makes great fun .
and i 'm going to you just in the next <unk> , <unk> minutes a little bit of this life expectancy of <unk> tell .
i 'm the ceo in <unk> .
the company , there 's been a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm the ceo of <unk> .
this company , there 's been 20 years .
and ceo of <unk> .
the company , there 's been about <unk> or <unk> years .
the runs the <unk> here at <unk> .
<unk> .
that a picture , that i do you here show you want to the little one point , right , that 's actually like a red , a <unk> on , or anything , does n't know , yes , this is still going to big .
there 's because the world 's just <unk> <unk> .
and of these are actually just now , 10 to action .
this shows , what .
there 's about 20 thousand active global <unk> .
so that 's actually not the market .
that 's also not time a niche interest .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why do you do that then i really ?
how about that all ?
<unk> in which was and only 10 to action , we do afterwards , to talk about why that 's .
very quickly to the story .
<unk> has a of you crazy <unk> <unk> the aviation and here by .
very short <unk> .
has to <unk> fourteen years ago , the first world war around <unk> <unk> into your life was launched .
then they were in the first world war , <unk> <unk> died on the way <unk> and <unk> , been around <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
the have then the london bombarded by and so on .
and when we <unk> and eight to london got these are , and with a big <unk> there 's a <unk> campaign to fly , were the english newspapers <unk> with the headline said , this time you come , but not with bombs , but in which peaceful intent .
so , the story there in <unk> .
and we had a 'm campaign .
but <unk> , the client , was not so very pleased , because he suddenly realized that 's become , there , behind it was the old memory in there put them .
and well , that was <unk> for the <unk> a critical .
but yet it was in london a good campaign , except the weather in the north up there was many years ago , very bad and very <unk> .
and we 're not very much flown .
then , <unk> two decades , <unk> <unk> hugo <unk> this has taken .
and has a <unk> <unk> , that then to america and delivered .
that has a myth where , that the german nation of , again something felt , as well , which <unk> and <unk> that airship kidnapped .
there was the then , in new york , receiving up with <unk> .
and the german nation 's up , <unk> , we are again , who .
this is in all <unk> so inside and that 's really that explains a bit of these myth of this device .
but actually are then to <unk> and <unk> only five , six seven <unk> even still were built and actually just two really big , the <unk> <unk> and the hindenburg , the passengers <unk> .
passengers , a hundred , where around <unk> passengers , and <unk> it was the end <unk> <unk> .
it was , but a myth .
and the <unk> then i was the first broadcast live <unk> crash , there 's also , yes <unk> .
next to the titanic that event that time , where a an icon , a product <unk> is , and then also never more and then the flight .
also the other devices have been at .
and <unk> , <unk> the past , existing <unk> destroyed .
the the materials used for <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> by .
and then i was a long , nothing about <unk> years .
and then the had the <unk> zf <unk> and <unk> the had the idea , maybe you should the back to start .
and i was hired <unk> , because you , technically a great product has evolved , we come in that , but the market .
yes , he 's actually a market ?
what is there 's actually go ?
so .
talk about we now .
the <unk> <unk> , this is perhaps , just to explain , we ham , time it 's still , <unk> , people who has a lot did .
there 's many companies , from this <unk> did .
it are today <unk> employees , about 20 billion of revenue .
this is a real <unk> , the profitable .
there 's a lot behind .
the have to me then , i 'm convinced , here and to come .
the <unk> , is actually a very regular plane as each other infinite plane , too , but , sorry , has <unk> a gas , the helium 's not hydrogen , and <unk> also a <unk> with <unk> .
it 's like a whale , in the water on and under up , and there the <unk> do .
the time now is not there , that in the details to explain .
inside it looks a <unk> so , with a structure .
there 's two of of <unk> .
there 's rigid <unk> , that we are , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
the have drawn inward , no structure and the 're sort of how balloons up in <unk> .
these are the most <unk> , in the world , built was are , about four , <unk> piece .
and of it 's only today , as i said , only still <unk> in which was minus to our own was , so around the only still two decades .
it looks like , then the production , if a shell where will .
the left the structure , .
and the shell is also <unk> .
it comes from the <unk> .
source : the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the origins .
it 's one point two million dollars , a shell .
and is to <unk> be , to <unk> , and must also <unk> be , because again and you have to yes , look , if time , these in it would or a hole that 's not on to suck .
there are doing the <unk> again <unk> do and look , whether they 're going on the holes that controls .
and the end looks a airship that without the <unk> , how it 's there .
the <unk> is so technically a <unk> product
and that you get down here , the numbers , very short time .
one point where nine percent , one point where nine percent , one point , six four percent <unk> , that means of a thousand flights in the year , about falling , maybe <unk> .
this is very very little and very good .
this is a <unk> .
the can , see .
but there 's a other trend , of us at about power and the have i ended up here , mapped .
we had three years ago <unk> percent <unk> , when i started to have ago , <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may , we were at <unk> percent .
if you the eight years , eight years , at <unk> <unk> and <unk> it to get to , then you can say at least in these eight years , of course , <unk> the <unk> , also , in these eight years , the weather clearly changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can there 's the passengers , not by the fog and fly .
the want , yes , something .
and the <unk> or <unk> up , every year , has been .
so a little <unk> of that our weather , not just felt , but also , statistically , because we make the weather , every day , changes .
but because that is that 's now that well , the e.u . a program <unk> <unk> to do , almost 10 million dollars and we 're an essential part of this program .
i come today morning , from finland .
that airship here is equipped , is a flying lab .
<unk> called the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between the earth and <unk> meters .
the means <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> t 's going , italy , up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
over many many hundreds <unk> measure the and analyzed the air , the way , <unk> , to it on our the things we the ground .
there , so i just explain , up there are we just with the second airship on .
a great a great commission .
and it 's when you so i want concrete derived from the subject of weather .
that 's so very good .
and here are , a few <unk> .
that airship , sweden , the last week or <unk> week .
and in finland is the way the weather super , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the <unk> say something like , they still never .
i did i 've got there just wonderful , a warm days experienced .
the mosquitos who were then also not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have for de <unk> as <unk> diamond , for , better said volcanoes for the <unk> are the away 're going through <unk> through a million years .
only can you , also ask , is , that 's all over africa , is that then a sense if you to make sense of questions , after a whole idea of questions , after a sense of questions is it makes sense when the same time in theater at the film <unk> or <unk> <unk> gone .
there , i time ever wondered , well , what do we there really ?
and what to support we there really ?
the end , we were after two years , then also done .
the <unk> went and then also not on .
the <unk> came back then <unk> and the project was then .
and a tornado , the <unk> the mast , then at that damaged , that he also the same way down to stay could .
i was , but not so bad .
we were there 's very good insurance , and they were actually very happy .
that was , which the prototype .
and i did n't know what i do with should .
yes , today we do , a very quick <unk> of the of the <unk> .
what today we do , it 's and just to , it 's going to the complexity , it 's going to ask , growth or was .
what today we do is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do any maintenance of course .
we we need to the <unk> always get .
<unk> called an aging .
there are yes , also make devices in , after 10 to fifteen , again , the be replaced .
we replace , the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients <unk> talk about we still .
we do we need to the <unk> constantly doing .
we 're a general aviation <unk> <unk> , of the germans <unk> and the european of control is , always , and the time , with <unk> like <unk> , or how we also an airbus .
that 's also <unk> and costs money and to and also get to be .
the question is , you do it actually on ?
you want on to evolve ?
you do it bigger <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
what makes you there really ?
about you go further in the market ?
about you go on the <unk> ?
and that we set of course , in my time , one .
and there , we also some <unk> suffered .
how the way , the <unk> <unk> some <unk> suffered , and times a bust .
at the <unk> stood still the donation of <unk> .
the population of the german , population has it was saved with six million <unk> as a donation , as the fourth airship <unk> , and he said in basically a bust was , the population of him a donation .
and it 's all the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the other companies did , otherwise we were or <unk> i am today anyway , not here and also other companies would n't there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco , with a client .
behind it was a very <unk> <unk> .
both of projects are , failed .
so , <unk> .
the same time we <unk> .
there , i did n't a picture that , because we that <unk> <unk> still not show you can .
but just in america is now the <unk> the first <unk> in the finished .
we have three of being sold .
with <unk> that we like a with a partner , the technology , new .
and that 's a great success , but at the defeat that .
two who are in basically <unk> been , because it 's not went .
why it was not ?
we know it actually already .
either was the location , not the right or the passengers had to go far <unk> or in america who knows i knew you <unk> the last 30 forty years , the advertising 've done .
the ham , people have <unk> , have the airship seen , have said , <unk> , again , again , <unk> , the power of advertising .
there can the did n't , you there <unk> can .
and it was actually as hard in marketing foods that over to : hey , and calls , and flying .
<unk> 's good .
the pilots to the year , transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year we just <unk> done because of weather .
there are then the same , even half a million .
this is then the bad .
the <unk> flies <unk> routes .
it 's the sense , of course , beautiful is , when i also as ceo , then i see how the passengers get out and , and all laughing and we in basically , not advertising , do , because it 's mouth to speak about and again and we got about <unk> sold <unk> have and the people say , that 's so beautiful , and i recommend it your friends , known and whom , and , in the family .
and we are great 's .
which i again and clean to with the mistake , you think we 're <unk> .
you could still more flights .
we 've been so a <unk> the <unk> and we were <unk> .
that is actually also not very much .
we do , advertising .
that 's time a project has been , this an audi <unk> .
and an audi this has done here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult to market .
and you must , sometimes , the <unk> imagine : do advertising , meaning ?
we have yes , to advertising , but the internet has a lot of changing the <unk> about the start to myself , because the <unk> all of control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , so there 's today is still 10 active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one , put that <unk> , three , <unk> bought , 10 are actively .
so are then six of 10 .
that means we will then the market , actually , if it does one is to control .
and hope , it also again a future get to .
and what the end with david , scott , commander of the apollo fifteen , after his <unk> paris <unk> and five , he has said , <unk> the walk on the <unk> what <unk> .
so <unk> 's nice .
advertising to find we also .
just find we do n't have any customers .
<unk> to do we find great , has a technological value .
there we have any customers .
this is not , has been .
it 's <unk> , goes on and .
so , so a <unk> takes years until you the get .
and then there 's then again , no .
there 's also be funny effect , the easy for and hard to control .
, is that the situation , <unk> , a point in the market , so , no market .
yet we do it on .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power , it .
they ask , just the question : in which form , we do it on ?
how much money we give in the market ?
what do what we do for here ?
in which shape is that by going ?
and i personally , they 've got me also asked , something personal to say , i 'm sort of the next to my history <unk> , where where i <unk> <unk> wanted to come back against the big <unk> , also <unk> has this little <unk> dead , to want , it 's also here to rescue .
i was also again , greenpeace , three years <unk> , when i went through the vancouver island risks , i 'm and this whole <unk> come seen have , has to me that <unk> , that i there , i do .
and then there 's a <unk> about greenpeace , in the money , being are and do n't know what they do with should , and almost it to essentially gone .
there you have to me <unk> , the very easy to <unk> .
and i have three years for greenpeace actually led me as <unk> and now i do that here in the hope , a long future in <unk> to achieve .
zero , this true ? of seconds , i 'm not yet done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , thank you .
that are my three key points , i in the <unk> minutes to talk to .
why we are today in from or in abundance ?
how we come to <unk> ?
and , all , what do ?
what 's what 's there really ?
we start with our first point .
the first part is perhaps a depressing .
but it 's also the drum , the challenges to show .
a few years ago about , that still more difficult been , that , to explain .
that we have a problem have today , i know that every child .
that we environmental problems .
but it 's worth , always been back the time to <unk> , are the challenges that growth , for example .
all kinds <unk> are exponentially up .
if you do it 's time in a historical long view , you see , the oil for example , is that a very short episode in the story has been to be .
the moment we can not imagine that 's kind of different about , when that oil and on up .
you know the climate change the last <unk> years .
some people say , well , used to be there 's time the columbian , we 're going to look at the last <unk> years .
that you can also <unk> at the <unk> ' i also , right .
you can also say , who needs because the glacier ?
you can also say , the ocean is far away .
but it 's then , if you , a little bit more specifically with , to sort real challenge to the things it really to avoid being true , otherwise we 've just having trouble in the <unk> , the health .
<unk> called it 's there days over 30 degrees .
and there 's degrees ' in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> , and more and further , bad .
it 's but also the <unk> , , especially in asia .
you think , the himalayas , where the big streams <unk> and the <unk> of them on that there and continuously water from the himalayas .
it 's about the last end not the planet .
the planet is that <unk> , what we do , there 's been much larger crisis .
and <unk> , but it 's going to us to the people , sort of in in a changed the ecosystems , <unk> will live .
it 's going to the loss , biodiversity .
the deserts <unk> .
the freshwater that will always be less .
this is the aral sea , where an essential part of cotton , from .
and that everything , where it 's that from ?
all these terrible things , say , i time , hanging in the time , or another shape with the global <unk> together .
with the , what we all of the earth out , what we harvest .
not just , the oil and the metals out and the minerals , but also the renewables resources are , renewable , but the last end just .
and we should just look , we so little as many of use to also last end less than waste and the emissions to produce .
it 's so that , that 's in the introduction was already said , i was the <unk> really dramatically to reduce .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just a c , o , two , <unk> of a car on a different , but really differently .
another way to economies .
our technology , completely new to change .
if we still time to look at the hunters and moving , and there 's still on the earth societies , in principle that life , come with a ton of resources in the year per person , and year .
in a <unk> it was then in the longest time the human history , three to five million tons .
today are it fifteen to <unk> .
so <unk> , this <unk> .
and he 's very , unequal distributed around the earth .
it 's in north , more than at us , we still more than for the earth , portable .
and in other parts of the world , you look on africa , much less .
and to come , we <unk> the impact at us , the rivers , the air is much better to become in the last decades , but it 's in basically that we that in other parts of the world <unk> .
and the other parts of the world , let me , that , but , less like .
and why are also the conflict , we see , of <unk> , is , afghanistan , where , you look at you on the maps of the american geological survey , and then you see , where the resources from .
and this is there 's where there , very colorful , which means , there 's a lot of resources , there , where the <unk> the world .
so if we do with clean want , then we need to us with the issue going .
so we need to change the ecological limits are everywhere , the <unk> is everywhere .
and that , what we here , <unk> lives have is that 's not <unk> .
that has already kind of mahatma gandhi , were as he has said , the world has enough for everybody 's needs , but not for everybody 's greed .
and there are we , we here in the average life , much about it .
so .
that was the sort <unk> part .
but i always , you the needs to understand it 's worth , also what to change .
also if i later would say , it 's worth , , like so , another way to live , which is more <unk> .
but it 's now , but again and sort , from the <unk> <unk> you need , a rationale , say , i time .
so , what 's actually <unk> ?
and there we have to find that we in our to share the world , so much , have an economically , socially , quality , standard , us in the average , not comfortable .
here 's a pretty good mood , but there 's people , and you sure , people , not so good deal , with this story .
i did the time i wrote that there .
<unk> and climate have the same cause .
we 're going to a lot and to the intensity .
this is the a side , we get ourselves in the stress , and eventually it is to be much .
i also very happy to .
and on the other cause we just this <unk> .
but what is then a good life ?
how do we the defining factor ?
now comes a a little piece of <unk> .
also that , what i did before i said that have and what i later tell you 'll is science , <unk> , but here is it 's just drum , how can i think that , first time that ?
and there 's important , to understand the quality of always has two aspects .
the quality , the aspect of the objective conditions as it me about , what i 'm going to eat .
i was a roof over the head ?
i was friends ?
i relationship , i can the life to participate ?
but that i also the way that 's me , so how to go , ' i ask ourselves with it to ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the perceived quality .
and then <unk> ' i have two words to introduce the , of the .
that a 's needs .
the needs are the very fundamental dimension of our human development , our there 's drum to feelings .
if we have our needs of satisfy , then we 're happy .
and needs , you ca n't say , needs are unsustainable , or not sustainable .
the needs by se lead , not to <unk> .
what are the needs ?
you can kind of scientists , quote , i 've got here 's only two , called .
and there you of the physical needs , but also need , after security , social relations .
after the protection , of participation , <unk> , creativity , spirituality , freedom .
all this has a bit of what do with money to do .
but to a lot of that actually do n't , but the question is , how can i told me that in my life up .
and there , i 'm the second important term .
the strategies .
the strategy , i 'm using the me to is to me this needs to meet .
and there 's then , drum , that i can sort with a high <unk> or with a low <unk> do .
there , i can actually much money you need , or a little money .
strategies that are just my behavior as i mean , needs <unk> .
that has with my values related to , with the resources , with the opportunities , i .
if i little money you have 'll ' i different from my needs to try to satisfy as if i sort of money on the bank account .
it 's first of the <unk> , is the roof over the head , to eat , and then , the <unk> .
and here 's then the drum , that can with a lot sooner or a little <unk> , that can kind of sustainable , or <unk> be .
and if we all the strategies , me to stand to my needs to satisfy the <unk> then talk , we of a lifestyle .
so .
that was the kind of scientific <unk> .
and now it 's drum , what we can do now ?
how it 's how about this ?
and there 's just a couple of evidence .
now , to this sort , everybody for , ourselves to find .
but the evidence of the individual way on a technological way , here is , think , i , a lot also about technology 've been and finally , on a political way .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what we do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides , the verge have sort , the danger is that we sort , more and consumption , more resources .
the last year after all the quality of them back down , because also the effects , even worse going to sort , and on us last end to beat .
or , whether we do it to create , , there in a different direction to go , with less <unk> , perhaps also with less than consumption , but with a higher quality that are connected .
there 's a my <unk> , maybe you know him some , <unk> of <unk> of this topic <unk> , so more of with less <unk> .
there 's a lot to technology as i can each one thing that here we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee , the car , the traffic , as i can that produce ?
cement , i can now , produce , i can that house of wood to build , et <unk> .
now , with a much less <unk> more or the same quality to create .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> this has been so in the <unk> per <unk> , and there we 're at the , today , too , time i discussed was is , there 's very deep down there on a 's companies to look .
where are actually the needs ?
the services can i really satisfy us ?
and how can i think that with more little <unk> do ?
and it 's not with a bit less , but with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there 's many examples of the that sort already .
in vienna to a tower being built to be with two <unk> .
with seven <unk> is it in <unk> already built .
in the essentially from wood , is .
that you , if you do it may be in its recent years , not more takes into , and then again in its parts and not sort , so , very much less resources , it with all other , coming , there , the moment with the half and the goal is with a fifth of <unk> , about the whole lifetime of the house that with this one fifth of <unk> long .
it 's but also a lot in our own , sort , like <unk> ' i really ?
<unk> <unk> has a book written , <unk> .
where he shows , how hard it last end is sort of really from the of the sort of <unk> out .
the <unk> , i want to me , go the other come after , and then i sort forever , in this in this race in .
you ask ourselves , sort 're , i quickly <unk> , and then get ' i the new .
the most <unk> ' i the <unk> , that you know of all .
when i my institute , by i few years ago , we still letters is written .
then , you , wait , until the letter back to write , i <unk> email , is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
to write , i hundreds of emails .
and i can be very much more afford .
this is productivity , that 's economic growth , we come in to that .
but i did n't really time has saved .
i did for me and <unk> done .
but there 's good examples , slow food for instance , where i really sort of the claim the quality and the claim the <unk> in the foreground , the .
and with a low <unk> more of do .
one of my <unk> is <unk> .
there 's a best-selling , you has pointed out that <unk> average person at us in germany , in austria , thousands of things in the household .
you can time to count .
who , two , three generations of thousands of things had , was having employees , personnel .
the have to us the managed dissent .
we need to myself to deal .
and , fewer people come to , with these all options .
and we need a raising the us and it , of us and <unk> with these few things <unk> .
about , think , i really interesting , is perhaps also , <unk> of the spaceship , there 's go , think , i , also not thousands of things .
the next example is use instead .
a real boom .
the star , <unk> , <unk> , , maybe , 20 years of , in the alternatives over been developed .
in the meantime , use it more and people , if you , <unk> think .
if you , <unk> think .
platforms , business , just to work , as you can look at the things , we already have these beautiful <unk> here , the years ago , a few hundred years was built still , use and still about the other centuries , to use it 's the last end .
that , even invested was just better to use .
this is the last end , a question of justice .
i 've got them before that sort of how profoundly unequal , that 's take you that as a picture , between africa and europe and a a <unk> world .
, so , all the same with these resources economy can 's only then as possible , if we really use less .
and that means that 's not less quality , because of us time , sort to be much .
but it 's a really important to the economy , the company , these products , those services , to ask the we need to us a good life to do with a much less resources .
last point , that has also something with the great public policy to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i think that time .
if you a little attention , the reading , is degrees , again from below oecd , <unk> , now that <unk> every week are these the back after the bottom <unk> .
it means , yes , a crisis is going on the door to my view , and also , and after the , what we sort of very much , economists 've talked and with have , here are the numbers for austria , you find that it for all countries growth , just after the bottom .
and there 's no reason , again , growth to have , so , as i think that from my youth , from the <unk> years know .
so , part , that in math reasons .
one point five percent growth is today , so much like eight percent growth , its recent years .
and that eight percent is that , what china , today .
the are also , there , where we may , its recent years were .
in general , if the pie bigger is , of course , is harder , times eight percent <unk> .
that a percent is still much , so we will be good living .
but you must , sort on it up , that means , not even if we are zero percent growth would have , would be that , the next year , so much to produce and consume and incomes , like in this year .
that we can be good to invest and so we can work .
that 's also why not so wrong , because you these statistics you know , the show that growth on , for , not more with the quality .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in in <unk> countries , about the was , the we are .
and the way , jobs are also , without growth as possible and that depends not so closely , together , like this tells us again and of <unk> and how they all say that suggests is .
that is simply not and then you have to , also time with the economy going .
and it 's coming again and and always more and that , also <unk> like the format , or next week , think , i , in coming in the trend , a larger story with this topic , start , <unk> .
so , <unk> , edward <unk> , then nobel prize in his <unk> with <unk> , he has said , the good life , the good economics , the good economy <unk> <unk> the good life .
it 's the last end , and not to not primarily to the returns to create , not primarily to growth to do what for our countries do n't even more about .
for the peru and those countries , also for china , for india there is that <unk> very different story .
and this is , just then we are also under <unk> , if we there , still growing , let and we just sort on this level , on this high level , the we 're good on life and economies .
to it takes a 's also , politics .
it takes some targets .
it takes some indicators , say the economists .
it 's not just sort of that growth , but we should really look and measure and ask , like that 's actually with the quality , up the , ?
is the down ?
and then also our politicians to measure .
of course , as high , is the <unk> ?
how about this sort together ?
we need a essentially one aspect of it 's the <unk> finally to tax avoidance and not the work .
who of them particularly the entrepreneurs of them , but also the employees , you know that very good .
what sort , to walk away , we know all times a colleague , paid .
that you could very differently .
the resources are sort down and why are the resources <unk> and not the work .
and you have to the last end all <unk> <unk> to something to create , to <unk> to ensure that 's health , infrastructure , without growth .
this is , but there , you have to , a bit better .
that means that conclusion , more or less , on all levels , in this direction , working to be , we can better , we as a company , the right products , and services as a consumer sort of us questions , what we actually , how do we that what 's sort good for us ?
what we need and what we may not ?
the politics , choose the framework put them .
a couple of evidence , i gave them .
and the last end of course , the science <unk> percent of <unk> 's still in the direction , how we can that growth and stimulate job ?
now , but unfortunately , nobody did .
if you the the look if you the development , look at the last 20 years , it 's always , the bottom , because it 's not about .
the politics , do n't and the <unk> will not growth to create , but this is the question how we go , to , and it 's so that we have a good life of have ?
so , <unk> 's do it .
be the <unk> you <unk> to lake .
with heart , the brain , hand , and the last end , the <unk> we 're going to need .
thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this town .
this town , so many stories to tell .
a sort of them , , a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving i in fact , and the story , later .
they 're going to have with the fortress <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> , here in the middle of the city is , and a lot of this city , is , and <unk> .
a different story , before .
it was , a hot summer in <unk> , nevada .
a man is , like , once in his shoes , right that it right <unk> .
that him to 's warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that 's not so with the heat .
he does then one he pulls the shoe of it takes a knife <unk> also not long going in , and it several times , there 's a lot of holes in .
he pulls the shoe , again , there 's be a knife in the way , and notice he has a climate in shoe .
it 's the shoe , breathing , born .
and this number , you see here is the in the <unk> of these billionaires , the mario <unk> today is .
a company is <unk> did , with four letters .
the , or another one of you know it .
he has the original idea , nike and adidas are .
both have been rejected .
so he says , well , <unk> , i do my own company .
<unk> is he , the stock market .
with today , several thousand on in just three hundred businesses in about <unk> countries in the world .
so much , the creative problem-solving .
why not something new to make up , still not there is ?
and mario , maybe the question i asked the , with <unk> exam , it .
if you <unk> still do n't know , it is for what is that a chance ?
this question , has to me , often it , in difficult situations .
if something wrong ran this is , or my collaborator <unk> me or technology does n't work or what 's also always .
<unk> , little memory , <unk> .
what is that a chance ?
and already come you from <unk> into <unk> .
what the difference can <unk> ' i do with this example here to illustrate .
and a different example , of the <unk> <unk> now , and it 's the <unk> of of <unk> .
and the evidence , like creative people can be when it comes to their own insurance .
i want you a few examples here .
the so these are actually so <unk> the <unk> <unk> and the , it also a ad .
i <unk> ' the amazing .
my son has the woman does n't <unk> .
he 's just <unk> , and it 's the wife by the <unk> <unk> .
or i had all the day , plants <unk> when i the intersection reached , grew up a sudden a bush in my <unk> and i could this other car , not more .
very clear , who 's one is , right ?
the bush .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> been , and two times , almost died .
there you can tell me , but at least that half <unk> on .
the last thing i was , the crash was n't blame .
one was the young woman in <unk> .
if you a man who are , is each one another explanation obsolete .
if you , but a woman who are , , it anyway .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish , and i dream of that we all the more of creativity to use .
a lot of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and this must not so be .
why not things just time i do differently ?
old the things we do , the routine become are , we may already bored , or <unk> , as opposite .
why the not just time i do differently , that <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there 's so <unk> company , the use this .
for instance , <unk> , have yet these <unk> of your blood run are , these signs , or , the wall , for example , and there is then maybe so what it .
also a way , right ?
time the coffee , stay , instead , <unk> .
or so what .
we have no <unk> , <unk> you .
is yes , today , <unk> , right ?
if you the phone , not anything you can .
or food they 're looking at me , otherwise , starvation , we both .
rude , creative .
so something needs it .
i talk about ' one of the client or an the then go , and say , okay , that they like me .
that <unk> ' i .
a <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> the current day <unk> , and it in <unk> .
once the sport , the current news , once upon politics .
if you there 's three on the <unk> was , is you <unk> .
even got the complaint about to long <unk> the food .
it 's a <unk> building and this restaurant , very small , so i had the chefs take all the hands of to do .
it was to look closely .
the have thought , together , what we do ?
how to solve , the problem ?
we can not faster , in the kitchen .
this idea is that .
on every table is a <unk> <unk> <unk> set fresh <unk> salt , pepper , and a <unk> .
so that , an , wait on it 's and eat their <unk> , time ourselves 're able to .
just a different .
a creative idea , and perhaps also with the <unk> solved .
there 's a person the power , currently not just very popular .
you this person is the leader , the <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .
and currently <unk> yes , the german orbit .
already the second day , that it still on monday , so four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> , on the month , one , and you know , maybe , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you .
the people come to us book <unk> .
the buses that are full , it 's <unk> run , people to organize , in the carpool , because each of course , after another , because for , of a , to b to come .
but why do n't time , now , use and creative , from his disadvantage do something ?
sometimes it happens , creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> might go out , at this company , that you may know .
so we have yes , we know that 's where the <unk> n't really good about , but that they 're looking at the <unk> also , saving to this is , but something <unk> .
or the <unk> in the car .
there we know , the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why , not a piece bacon the car on , if you <unk> 's right ?
or at <unk> 's also the ways , the creative , to make .
and all that has to do simply with humor , with joy , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son , at me in office .
and sitting on this <unk> ago me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the <unk> .
and then it turns out he from left , right , he gets pleasure , and i in my stinking <unk> say , to the you , listen , on , this is yes , not a playground .
he wants to me , at me , big eyes , but the playground .
and in the moment <unk> ' i actually has he 's right , right ?
why is that 's not a playground today ?
why is that , what we do , not the playground for adults ?
that 's about , but very much more sense , right ?
if we are relaxed are , if we have our talents to use that do , what we like to do .
and so <unk> getting , but it relaxed way .
that to is that , when a particular day , the week from then it changes , what in our brains .
it 's the first day in the week , and somehow it 's our focus on a other day .
so , other day , we mostly , rather .
so in the weekend .
that sounds you yes , already in the media .
the <unk> is yes , only still a day to the weekend .
or if then the most beautiful time the year , announced that 's going to the vacation .
what are then the rest <unk> weeks of the year ?
it 's so awful ?
we all so terrible jobs ?
a <unk> had it 's time on the front given , this topic .
yes , monday , you can ' i and the rest of life , please ourselves .
or on <unk> , on facebook , all over the social networks is this issue up .
once <unk> i go through the <unk> , the <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of business and i look at me , like this .
what have the so in the <unk> , what 's there that ?
and one day <unk> i 'm going on this business with these <unk> to buy .
and the first sign that you see here , yes , that is yes , very nice .
so , of with so i love to do instead to work .
i <unk> that yes , too , i 'm a father of five kids , but i love , my work now .
yes .
or a quiet <unk> for <unk> is that <unk> sign .
why that your mindset , the , there 's degree becomes , and it always more and always on .
somebody has been there , as an answer on this direction , posted it 's not the monday , it are your jobs .
and i ask even in fact , with the pink , glasses , here forward to come and say , okay , do ' time a shift .
what , my job is beautiful ?
this silly , is , also if it 's the pink , glasses , is , it looks like everything in a bit of how do before .
so something beautiful to talk , that 's not beautiful is , it 's obviously not .
the pink , glasses , is the way , super , bike , drive .
there 's you a wonderful , the fly . , otherwise the eye , it would .
but to <unk> <unk> they do n't .
where is us that , if we do n't that change ?
actually the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside , <unk> .
it ends , maybe in a system where we so similar to us feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this wheel , and running and running and it , and eventually it 's going to quickly , this wheel , it caught the poor mouse and they <unk> out .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know , nothing else , she goes back in the <unk> .
and again , and again , and again , maybe the movie , every day <unk> that <unk> you may all , falls , yes , soft .
this is beautiful <unk> here with hay , so they do , yes , there <unk> and it 's and over again , there .
and that , what we as funny and feel probably has the mouse , at once a concussion , yeah ?
or something needs it , <unk> <unk> .
i 's many years ago , when i way was from a seminar to home .
and on once she , so the street under me , felt it was very , black , my eyes and somehow got ' i stand .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , what is there on ?
he started studying at me and said , no way that 's physically , everything in order .
but how to look , with the <unk> from ?
and i looked in my calendar , the to check , and saw , i worked for three weeks , and somehow <unk> me , the job .
after 20 years in the <unk> and collaborator , as the first in the early , asking whether we look at night to finally can do .
i also thought , what 's actually , otherwise , for jobs ?
and i started , <unk> , again , other priorities , to put them , to look , time with my family <unk> ' , something good for me to myself doing .
<unk> ' , whether it 's not <unk> other <unk> there in my job , a new of .
i realized , the talks , large groups , make me , pleasure .
i do ' , like , counseling and <unk> and also other things , but those talks impulses give to the experience to share , we 're me , pleasure .
and this was n't always been so .
i 've got myself , you have to that this <unk> stress sick .
and sometimes need it 's really this shot , the <unk> so , <unk> of me is a degree , again from the hospital , let 's been , after he 's a heart had , and on , so he also , <unk> .
it used as i said , you do with some jogging , he told me , <unk> , yes , you with your running and so .
today is he ourselves .
so , with <unk> , beautiful slow , in the right <unk> , but eventually we will also , together , jogging , go .
what ?
the bottom line , we all the healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve , up , is the diseases of mental health .
<unk> minus four percent in the <unk> last 10 years , <unk> almost minus its percent , that 's beautiful , this is less .
of the psychiatric disorders , plus <unk> percent .
this is something , where i think , to that be ?
why is that ?
there is the only in austria , so ?
no , also in germany , it 's so .
<unk> , <unk> , that will all , healthier .
this is so here on the left to recognize .
very bottom of psychiatric disorders , almost plus a hundred percent in the last 10 years , you find a a big german <unk> out .
the number <unk> drugs , to .
also the cost .
and it just think , all kinds of official , what we can do with this topic ?
do to make suggestions , sometimes come , it , involuntary <unk> , like the example here .
so it 's good that .
and somebody has once said , no alcohol , is also not a solution .
but what is then the solution ?
what is then that , what we now , but again , healthy , and too , and with pleasure to ?
and that has to me the last years .
i thought , there 's something like <unk> , it 's something like all be ?
i 'm <unk> , the job is not that , what we <unk> too , and happy to do .
there 's many other things , are important , family , health , think , and so forth .
but in fact is yet , we the the most of our <unk> in the work to spend .
and if we do that , why then not that do that 's us pleasure for and also the other .
the <unk> <unk> ' i do you <unk> , as the last , provide anything like to <unk> and , <unk> .
these little had , you , hopefully then it easier to realize .
<unk> is for talent <unk> , freedom and environment .
that means , like <unk> ' i mean , talents ?
in which the environment , do , i think that , also with whom ?
the freedom i ' i 'm here to do that , what i do want ?
because it 's the degree of <unk> , of us <unk> .
ever more of them , <unk> more stressed .
and what do what i do it ?
the <unk> .
that are these four areas .
and it can everyone for , myself , check .
i had this for me to myself doing , a few years , and i do that <unk> , again .
can i mean , talents and ?
in which environment ?
and that means , sometimes you go , i in a cafe with my laptop , the seminar prepare , or a <unk> .
the freedom .
the freedom , i take to try to do this , what i 's important .
and do i 's also ?
the <unk> .
the last u .
and then there 's and again and people , me explain , why do n't that 's .
and why that , you very much harder .
then i mostly , like an answer , of the .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't , the reasons .
and by , of the you can , pick <unk> ' i ways , `` get ' i ways , or i ' i reasons why ?
and they 're in both right .
what we do so with our talent ?
each of them has its large <unk> around .
the is yes , small .
the is filled with a talent , with the gold , with all kinds , with their skills .
what we do it ?
by the end we ask this .
or if we in hospital are or the end of life .
what i with my talent done ?
the way , who 's got has on <unk> <unk> , can look like afterwards , here 's still access .
so , what we do with our talent , is so my first question , also , i consider myself , and it every day .
<unk> ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was , but still something with a story .
the i 'm going to tell about <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i , of the still do .
this fortress which was the rescue committee for the <unk> as long ago <unk> <unk> years , the enemies up .
and the enemies , we realized that these fortress so well , built was , you do n't take could .
thick walls <unk> ways , the <unk> to the fortress , thick and doors , <unk> , times <unk> .
i was <unk> time .
so we thought , this , okay if we do n't come , and we have a <unk> .
we let 's there 's no more out and in .
time looking at how long , the that there , endurance .
the <unk> it was from long until the day came , where the <unk> almost it was .
they had only still a <unk> the was already the way to slaughtered them to be as the <unk> on once the bishop says , the bishop give me this <unk> and give me three days .
bishop okay , <unk> , you did you <unk> , i <unk> , you , come to take the <unk> and help us .
<unk> goes with the <unk> way .
on once look down the enemies , how about the wall of the fortress is a <unk> moved to run by always going back from left , right , and already in the early .
well , thinking , , a <unk> , what is that already .
it 's <unk> .
again , is a <unk> <unk> , up on the wall of the fortress , this is he however , black .
enemies are thinking , oh , still has two <unk> , it can ' , something to take you .
at night , the same scenario , time , this is he knows the <unk> , there on and ab led to .
the second day , after the six different <unk> have seen the bottom , moved to you in a <unk> .
because they thought , that takes us to long , that would think we ourselves , not more .
and then went to the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the a , they had , and the they <unk> .
that are the <unk> <unk> did .
i like this idea that everything there is , what we need , and that we all have .
sometimes we 're it <unk> resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's little .
but also , so we can now , but do something .
we have no idea of the power , we have the world every day to invent .
and if you believe that could now a good <unk> be then you have been right .
in the spring from the spring .
the coming .
and we in <unk> know there is the snow , there 's a 's warmer and there 's start with the plants , of branches brown <unk> to green <unk> .
there , blooms eventually come from these blooms fruits .
there to apples -- here 's very popular , then we harvest and eat .
there 's grain of this grain could we then <unk> and bread , baking .
there 's any animals , that to eat .
there 's people , then the products that it later , food .
and it 's automatically .
if you , but i think about that may not so and everything is then it 's a fear and so anxious .
and of course , is this threat , maybe just very abstract and also very theory , but just in the blooms , the connection of the flower to plant to play the bees , a very , big role .
there 's research , the show that to <unk> percent of our food , at particular food is n't there were if we ca n't make bees have .
also that sounds , so <unk> , because it , `` normal for us is , and we need bees might also not so perceive .
there 's now , some time , a very interesting movie , <unk> , the issue .
and i recommend you , if you look at it .
now , but look forward , we the gentleman <unk> , which is just with the bees are working , in his high school , in <unk> the importance of bees , the power .
that does he here , a school , <unk> and he 's going to us now a lot about his work to tell .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
first time a thank you , mr. <unk> and , the <unk> .
that i 'm here with my project , <unk> or <unk> something that you can not about that live in the bees .
and that 's also still under a wing of <unk> something about a little <unk> to tell that makes fun .
there , i assume you can not the most of you <unk> in the are it now today at night a <unk> company , in <unk> minutes in the basics of beekeeping bring to .
that , do i do n't , no .
but perhaps make it me , you to get that you this <unk> start to love or a certain amount of empathy them to to develop and you to engage them for this <unk> <unk> , <unk> bug , <unk> .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years of young , i 'm with a wonderful woman , married , father of five children still not <unk> and have different <unk> and <unk> finished and i 've been working <unk> years in the <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in <unk> <unk> and the non-profit group <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> top of <unk> with our oldest students in <unk> .
we 're working there in the garden , in the agriculture and in the beekeeping .
<unk> is yes , actually a play of <unk> <unk> and is all of <unk> <unk> .
we 're flying the classroom is more like a <unk> , a silence , a steady thing .
and you to also to calm .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and not for have been the old greeks the correlation between the honey , so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> know .
and in a wonderful verse of homer , describes that he 'd like the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the sleeping poet out to him to inspire , he again , thick .
but the <unk> go there 's not myself to myself , but they send their blue bees and <unk> now the poet of the lips , with the wax and they crawl into the mouth , in and back out with him later , the words like the honey from the <unk> flow .
a beautiful picture .
hopefully you get me that today , evening .
yes .
this flying the classroom .
i come to the project .
one of <unk> , this <unk> the just now my students with me , built have come for 30 to <unk> days in a <unk> .
in <unk> schools of us in <unk> into school or in the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> after <unk> .
a <unk> after <unk> or in classrooms , us in <unk> .
the teacher , this project by about with me in the class , and we 're looking for a put room for so a <unk> .
most of the window to the children , can see during this month .
and , all things , with the bees , then in there are by the up out and again <unk> .
there will then the window , up .
so .
and then start with the entire at me on the <unk> .
i guess so a <unk> and <unk> ' now from a existing <unk> two <unk> out and <unk> you now here in these <unk> in .
it on this on this <unk> are <unk> so honeybees .
also important , we have here <unk> <unk> , and here to the edge , fresh <unk> be , so fresh eggs .
and then that i also a <unk> , up here .
there 's the honey , in .
the they need to get a bad weather is , and they do n't fly .
so .
it looks like that then .
then it 's the <unk> here again on and instantly it starts the transportation , the for <unk> places , or , the for <unk> place in the school .
and now start seeing something wonderful .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , these bees in there , then in the class are experience of a crisis .
you people 's not more .
they are lonely .
they find your queen 's not .
and this is the most important task from <unk> , when he made this <unk> order to that he looked attention , the queen sitting in the old people left .
that the so not on these two <unk> sitting .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they start , to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , they <unk> .
you hear that .
they just sums up almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen together .
and now start a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night that they now , the necessity , a new people to the reasons , and the whole thing happened without <unk> , <unk> , without the conferences , without having , without the opinions and those positions .
here is the people , agree and it then in the first night , here 's a <unk> .
because without the queen going to this people , after six weeks , not more exist .
because <unk> lives only six weeks for .
so .
and in this first night out , from one of <unk> a pen out a fertilized egg , and bring that in this <unk> in .
and there <unk> to then <unk> queen going .
everybody , of you <unk> in the high school was , says , how do that because they go ?
yes , genetically <unk> , is , all genetically <unk> .
this is true .
and now start seeing something wonderful .
this an egg , what 's normally in the <unk> a <unk> become it 's in the <unk> a queen .
the egg , the first three days in the same genetic code , like the <unk> .
after that will it gets fed up from a <unk> <unk> .
you know this term .
and instantly it changes , on this <unk> on <unk> imagine the genetic code .
the <unk> going through the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> changed .
we had the earlier , time i heard that , what we eat , that determines , of us will .
and the queen is that really wonderful to experience .
three days , egg , five days <unk> .
and that can the students all <unk> .
that you see in class .
and then is this cell <unk> with a <unk> wax and the whole thing happens then also not , because , that people now , democratic to <unk> or because of <unk> says , do it be , you <unk> a group , says , you do that now .
no , that happens <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> decision .
and then for the students are eight days , my graduate student knows , three , five times eight a queen , so <unk> days that these queen <unk> .
and the day , if that then , so i 'm going to the teachers , that wrote in the <unk> there <unk> the <unk> the students up to five o'clock , yeah .
and then he says the mother , tell time , what 's because with you go ?
yes , i must be in school .
yes , why , because that ?
yes , our queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then we are the morning to six in the school .
and then the press the , their <unk> down , this <unk> , because they <unk> want , like this queen 's now <unk> .
and if you that really experience , then you first learned something .
this queen <unk> .
so .
still a little bit higher .
and then get the <unk> and cutting the queen 's free .
the first , what these queen of power , at their wings , and there are now with their <unk> that people what , ourselves a queen 's moved , their own smell , you <unk> , their <unk> .
that people who has now again , identity .
now are three to five days for the queen fed up .
the <unk> front get you their <unk> <unk> .
the back from the <unk> out , from the people , from this <unk> .
and after five days going to this queen 's one of the <unk> out .
some think now , yes , i 've been time ever seen , a <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> , stop .
what 's completely different .
-- that let we .
this queen the flying now by ourselves without <unk> , without <unk> , from this <unk> out to two miles high .
they have surely , time ever seen in your <unk> .
in the <unk> and is there in an <unk> now <unk> , of seven to 12 drones , the male bees .
so around like in islam , where the man of women have to here 's the queen , the seven to 12 , men .
and the whole thing happening in a wonderful way in flight .
the drone is coming from the back <unk> these queen , and this queen 's being now in an flight , all that , what you , seeds need to for three years eggs to put them .
for the drone is it also a an experience .
if you 're done is , <unk> dies , and falls dead by the sky .
and then it 's the queen and back and starts , eggs to put them .
it 's always a , two students in the class , that immediately see .
the also see immediately the queen .
yes .
and then turned slow this project in the school , because now going to the <unk> again <unk> and the queen and the <unk> is that now to look closely in there .
and then come i one night , then before to this <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> of the outside , and the next morning <unk> ' i do this <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and there , here you 're still the queen .
yes .
fresh <unk> .
and around the most of 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then comes this , these two <unk> come now here in a <unk> .
in a full floor , in a prey and now , this people , big and <unk> be .
why the bees in the school ?
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , the children , that have to forget that never more .
yes .
there is yes , not just so , in this class , then the students all the time with the bees , are , but the entire school . yes , in this class in .
and the teacher , when he 's something you know , when he 's something can , when he when he , there something for has the can an era , the other and join .
if you look at the bees and <unk> <unk> ago <unk> years , we have a cave paintings , where the people , the honey <unk> .
a few months ago , you in israel <unk> years old <unk> found in which the people at the bees thought .
any human culture has with honeybees <unk> .
or around the bees were at every culture .
in china , in india in persia , in egypt , in greece , in rome .
everywhere , they were .
the human cultures , ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
he can a <unk> , a <unk> join , he can a <unk> join .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , you know , which flowers , or the trees , the bees <unk> , what they need ?
that you out there now , anything to find , now in summer in the agriculture .
this out there , that 's a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?
he can tell ourselves with the students in the <unk> go and there , flowers and plants and bees are able to the <unk> you mark and look , how long need the right now , from <unk> to my flowers ?
how long , they 're on the individual blooms ?
and how long they need , until they come back .
he can <unk> <unk> hold .
how <unk> i a hexagon ?
yes .
you know if that is so , in the <unk> the top , the top is , or <unk> flat on after the top is ?
you look , right .
he can a math -- , a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can with the students , even the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> explore .
and then come he wants to the question , how could karl from newly <unk> the nobel prize even get ?
because he accepted , that the bees that 's see in the beehive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a hive , it 's <unk> .
there 's like this also a bee .
and just the professor <unk> , many years in <unk> , the university , she has the , in <unk> <unk> the bees , there a <unk> create the individual <unk> .
as a <unk> web of the wax in the <unk> a <unk> do , and now with <unk> hertz , their <unk> there a , and the bees , the <unk> , in with their legs , with their <unk> .
you see , what these bees in the school to do ?
it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the kids lose their fear , the bees .
and develop a awareness for the bees .
they learn , <unk> , look what the bees do .
and they get a warning , these creatures , what in basically took only for us people who lives .
the bees do to wax still not time a 70 pounds per people in the year .
ago <unk> years , the only way , candles make .
they collect , the <unk> out , the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , with the <unk> you people .
and now imagine you time ago , in summer , that are <unk> -- , <unk> bees on that 's a narrow the room , at <unk> degree .
hey , there 's infectious diseases , without end .
no , the bees do n't .
because they have in this <unk> natural antibiotics .
they collect the pollen , and it , it <unk> , he will , <unk> , a able <unk> .
someone , the , the <unk> your is , pneumonia <unk> , <unk> the can now to a <unk> go and , a <unk> prescribe let me , by he the <unk> of the people <unk> .
now , there 's a year before and with <unk> with a <unk> and so , there 's nothing .
yes , and then i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that pollinating the <unk> do that the bees course , and we have less apples , if the bees and there was n't fly , or we have to be like the chinese that the <unk> <unk> and they themselves pollinating plants .
there 's much more the importance .
if you look at the <unk> , out there on the meadow , is the also the growing on the <unk> , where the cows graze again .
and there is that flies underneath the bee to myself , up , their nectar and it 's fermented and this <unk> .
and now comes the cow and <unk> the <unk> and just , because they <unk> <unk> pick up , they can digest .
yeah ?
and then <unk> you that again , and notice , ah , i <unk> <unk> , ah , i can do it again <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yeah ?
and to a last but those the bee of us the most valuable , what it on the of the nature , there .
the honey .
i want , just to the point to come , <unk> .
my students to be happy , every year , if you this <unk> build and then , partly with me together in the schools , go .
that 's now , not my <unk> but even when i had a student , and there , i said , in <unk> in school in <unk> and i said , you , <unk> , put you ourselves .
and then he says , yes , i hot . ' <unk> <unk> .
i come from <unk> , <unk> and i 'm 20 years .
and i 've been five years in <unk> and since two years , thomas in <unk> .
and i 'm ' me , i 'm going to do n't even more with the <unk> learn to , but with the hands can take from .
<unk> , yes , with the head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , <unk> school .
and more than the half , oh yes , that we also .
my students see here 's an enormous appreciation and the all between , in <unk> , normal , and the <unk> people will go through the bees , as .
on playing field to you , and they get some confidence , my students and a certain proud .
how come you to the bee ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , how come you , <unk> the <unk> ?
and there is that mum , i , also there 's the human , the other people <unk> and he 's a new <unk> there .
and he says , so , start with it .
at a poem from <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee will be the sun shining through the <unk> feel the way to the blossom , and never the direction , you lose the <unk> the fields in <unk> gleam of how quickly he also lived , he 'd hardly ever cry .
thank you .
hello , love her friends in all the world .

and there were we then of this <unk> female <unk> .
when i then i heard that <unk> percent of everyday victims <unk> are the rest 're christians and <unk> i ' i thought about how can a <unk> like the islam , next to all of terror , that still <unk> in the shoes and push let me ?
and the idea was born in the highest because of islam , to the need to sin to explain .
we 're looking for <unk> at the germans organizations , we do n't have found .

they <unk> <unk> , a <unk> to be the women 's wrong , has created and why you , well as <unk> human <unk> could , women <unk> .
but now , we had the images of the first <unk> was this <unk> .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there 's hard discussions , two days for .
but we had the minister on our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and then the great decision , the practice is against all rights , against the religion , we need to him one .
as recently that has the way <unk> this new <unk> signed .
and if you africa and the <unk> know , i know , just that has for these people are valid .
and it was celebrating , and these successes , we had then also in other countries .
quick example , , <unk> there <unk> us the highest spiritual , the <unk> the country , his message that 's a crime is , on <unk> to write and that now in the <unk> to wear .
for weeks , we were the way , with your <unk> .
a hundred <unk> we had .
and where we came , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical , the holy hospitality , experienced .
and when we the country , some point out to , i said , the great scholar and <unk> <unk> , you want to now , all <unk> countries to happen ?
so much lifetime will <unk> you ca n't even more to be .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> and there , you have to slow to the whole thing to come .
and , all , he had an idea .
he said , if it you get the ten <unk> muslims , the world , a table to and the explain the need to sin , then it 's a sin .
<unk> and i flew in cairo , in the <unk> and -- the mosque comparable with the vatican , the <unk> .
and the <unk> for <unk> quite the <unk> , his <unk> professor doctor ali <unk> we got a <unk> .
he heard , the idea , was thrilled , ago all , when we him the notion that we fund would .
and that we do it just about <unk> , the us support .
and then he said , i 'm going to the conference is not just <unk> , we put it 's been asked had , but i 'm going to the <unk> taking .
and that has he did .
over cairo <unk> some point in the years <unk> our government transparent .
international <unk> , on the <unk> the female body through cut .
the <unk> the <unk> professor doctor ali <unk> .
and all these are they did .
a hundred <unk> , but the highest the world .
in the middle <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and the rest of europe , he 's the cause of <unk> because of cartoons .
so men the life and death to decide .
but that i also the other .
the left the <unk> <unk> , right , the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest the world .
about where i <unk> me just still a vacuum , and <unk> personal .
and then i they all of a .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at <unk> from left <unk> of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> egypt , <unk> of my wife , mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much for the subject , of islam is not <unk> .
we also the medical <unk> the on their way , time <unk> , terrible , you women there <unk> , with the <unk> .
and then to <unk> your film to show <unk> .
reality .
the men had the wet eyes .
they , back behind <unk> doors , just two hours , you had decided , and a <unk> wrote , a <unk> .
the <unk> kick , the cameras , <unk> , what you decided .
and the most important set , that was this .
female <unk> is a <unk> crime , that against the highest values of islam <unk> .
he <unk> the <unk> .
we thought , the job is done , but the calculation , without our <unk> .
because the shame , about the abdomen using the woman to talk , is stronger remained as everyone 's mind .
that we <unk> .
we have this we have the conference , documented in that we call the golden book .
a <unk> for the <unk> this world .
and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it so well , i found that book , he 's with a <unk> blessed .
it 's going to us from the hands out .
we were in many countries had then the conferences , hold up with the of the highest <unk> .
and they read that with interest in some were so excited , the book <unk> .
unfortunately , but we have the most not the courage to put that now , to announce that .
over the abdomen using the woman can you 're not in the mosque to talk .
just some have the courage to put them .
they 're looking at least in the universities are gone , on <unk> .
and sometimes we have some of bold <unk> found the fact , in the mosque , <unk> have , like here .
and then it 's going out about the speakers in the <unk> .
and that are yes , the individuals .
the will it spread .
but i 'm going to the time .
it are all you drop on the hot rocks , and it work i , many other strategy , this topic , <unk> .
the practice <unk> .
but my <unk> that this .
i want to the great message the highest <unk> the world to announce the birthplace of islam is here , the kaaba , in mecca .
not , so <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
if here four million people come together , men and women <unk> islamic currents .
then <unk> ' i do with all the and the <unk> king of my transparent up there 's between the minarets <unk> .
how i that here , time , trained have in the <unk> .
unfortunately , lacking in me , the last <unk> , that would be the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure , when he of <unk> would he 's coming up .
, to these women to help .
the other , to the time to show , which the real value of islam , are , instead , constantly demonstrate to .
from terrorists than <unk> .
if i do n't that do then <unk> ' i may have this , in hamburg , its had .
that at least a lot <unk> in the mosques up in all the world .
and we transparent , there <unk> could .
and maybe <unk> i do it , that little girl , his daughters were n't even more <unk> .
then , my life , really worth it .
and i appeal , every , that now heard , or seen , <unk> .
also not join this is already a <unk> .
we need to the practice in the ton of , otherwise <unk> i 'm here of this stage , not .
and now i want to conclude the design of my <unk> , even show .
this is my <unk> , <unk> .

down there , we did it then also in german .
female <unk> is with the koran , and the ethic of islam , incompatible .
you is <unk> and a discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i start , so that time .
so we looked at the <unk> from , you as a refugee , in germany .
the <unk> attention <unk> have my mother , my brother and i for the first time , a package <unk> .
it made <unk> .
my mom was completely terrified , because they did n't understand , why the us now <unk> food , given .
the third day , we finally <unk> .
we were the trash to this stuff back to throw away then came a <unk> wife and <unk> that simple , <unk> .
they tried to us to explain , hey , that you can eat .
this is not <unk> .
that tastes , very good .
it 's the cheese .
my mother had moved to the eyebrows up and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my country , we did it <unk> but the has not so <unk> smell .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
ago in fifteen years , i 'm with my mother and my brother of china , germany , and fled .
of escape <unk> ' i now tell .
but , all , it 's going to me about the people , these escape to have and to a success 've done .
but first tell ' i them , where i right from .
i 'm <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> , in the northwest of china life .
and this region is the chinese that autonomous area <unk> called .
it 's about <unk> miles from germany away .
in china to live in 10 million <unk> but in munich 's the <unk> community of china .
and this <unk> life , so here because we in china under the continuing <unk> suffering .
hundreds of chinese were extra to <unk> relocated , so we in our own home to a sizable minority become .
our own native language , <unk> was out of education eliminated .
in schools and in university will only still in chinese taught .
and our religion can we also not free <unk> .
the <unk> losing so their culture and identity .
and if , somebody is courageous , is , and for the right the <unk> in risk for sentences , torture , or even the death .
that was also the reason , why my parents , that they decided to have , with us kids to escape .
that was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this picture is a moment ago , of escape from .
we did n't enough money , and so we had my father , first time behind .
i <unk> ' me , many people , the us at the escape , have helped .
i <unk> ' me , many images .
i <unk> ' me , but first , <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i just , it right , me , when i my eyes <unk> .
he was big had <unk> <unk> , , and we met him , with his little <unk> on a parking lot .
the first rate was to .
i know that 's a lot of a negative image of <unk> have that the only do business to refugees use and , not for the fates care .
but i <unk> ' say , i <unk> , it as <unk> call , not as <unk> .
because <unk> has us several months by .
he stood on the airport in <unk> on a <unk> and has to the last end <unk> , whether we also really sure the <unk> up .
airport in <unk> we came , and i still , as my mother of , to me she 's just get out of the airport .
about you 're not to .
until we 're out .
because i had , in my hand a pass and there was also my photo in but there was a stranger name , <unk> .
i had as <unk> through the <unk> .
and i <unk> ' me , <unk> <unk> of me <unk> he had my pass in the hand .
silence .
sweat .
a long view .
we were finally <unk> .
in munich , came <unk> ' i , many of the first responders , we kind of very strongly supported .
i <unk> ' me , the <unk> woman , with us in <unk> used .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per <unk> 13 , families .
one of children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
it was stranger faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a <unk> share .
there was being eaten , slept and homework done .
friends who came to do n't want to visit , because i <unk> , where we <unk> .

they knew my story and <unk> me , and they took care , me .
for instance , brought me tell you to <unk> <unk> what i 'm going to do n't even more do .
but they helped me , somehow , german were to meet .
i spent my whole puberty , in <unk> .
that was for my mother 's not easy .
alone with us kids , without your husband and always in the uncertainty , because we had yes , just a <unk> and we could n't any <unk> be .
i <unk> ' me that i , really aggressive , was to the time .
it 's me , little bit embarrassed , that now here 's all to tell , but now i have to just to my story .
i was very aggressive and i could get me in the school , bad , sort of focus .
the brought us first to the catholic <unk> where we for the first time with the normal young kids in touch it came .
with the normal , my goodness ' i children , not in a <unk> live to .
i <unk> ' i also , the <unk> the me and my brother . to <unk> or <unk> sent to have .
just so we bit out .
i <unk> ' i also , several <unk> <unk> the with us homework done have , because our parents did n't speak german , we could n't .
or the have with us just painting .
we 've always very was .
i still , as we 've always going on the fence line up and waited until these people came , because , somehow i took , strangers , people for us , and this was telling us that time .
after two years , came finally , my father , germany .
the problem was , but that he 's directly from <unk> after <unk> <unk> was because it in munich supposedly , no place , for him , there .
i <unk> ' me , the very , who lawyer , it has , my father , the <unk> after china to keep us they made it even that he 's at us in munich live , having me .
i <unk> ' me , this time where i really then , really glad i was , because after six years <unk> got we finally in a normal home to .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we had finally , your home with a own bath , and one of your kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was , very small and i did n't have desk in , but it was good , i was my door <unk> .
and i <unk> ' me that i the time , very good for you have , but i had yet the <unk> without a major leave .
i looked for me really not a perspective .
there was a <unk> , me in <unk> always been supported , and it still do with the idea that i think about the second <unk> my degrees <unk> can .
first <unk> then the <unk> .
i thank the teacher , really , i thought , and i was really not just to the time i made i do it even to the middle <unk> .
and then i came to <unk> .
and before i , <unk> came , i played the way with my best friend <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project of organized <unk> .
but i was no good <unk> that i ' i also only done because we 're going through <unk> a place , where we just go to .
we had a valve , what we <unk> <unk> could .
and the ladder of <unk> helped us sort of that we our problems with him tell you could and he <unk> us and i could get us at all of questions of <unk> .
and then i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and that 's a project , where young people without a major the opportunity to get , artistic <unk> .
that has to me really very well done , and i realized , art is something what i 'm also a little <unk> .
by <unk> and the contact to <unk> was a filmmaker , on us .
he made the movie <unk> about the lives of my friends and me .
and the film he won lots of prices .
we realized that the people , for our story was interested .
he was a very special feeling , because we do it 's still never had had to people we 're listening .
and that was so a moment , where i thought , okay .
i do n't want more <unk> .
i mean anything from my life .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees , came to me with the idea , to a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
but there , i in the <unk> building me completely lost , i ended up at random at a <unk> for a play and the title is <unk> one to four .
so i was just right .
i was playing with .
and this thing is , after a performance , two editors , from <unk> <unk> on me <unk> .
and asked me , had , if i interest to have just one time , your <unk> to do .
i thought , super , <unk> .
i realized i do , i do with .
and i made for the <unk> <unk> , now , pulse <unk> and one of contributions about a play <unk> , in the i also ourselves <unk> was for the european <unk> nominated vice versa .
and i 've got it also actually won .
by studying , i , the school for <unk> and movie munich <unk> , the third year , and i 'm <unk> the <unk> .
and all that would be for me not been possible if not one or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> well , for me to be used to have .
they have , i did you have to me spaces open , they have to me ways that , as i would place in the society , i <unk> can .
and to come , i now to them .
each of them , the way , people like me to help the second chance to get , and their lives , or their place in the society to find .
because the people , every day come <unk> hundreds of refugees in munich , and each of you 're full of hope and each of them has a huge potential .
they have it with big , determination did many terrible are behind , to .
and with this determination you could really big profit for germany , and for every single one of us , too .
and i could actually thousands of things to tell what you can do , but there , i do n't even more enough time you have even though there is , a minute , its , i put them a <unk> brought .
<unk> you now your phone out , you can i did n't tell you to no code <unk> .
scan you the code , and then they come on the side of <unk> with many suggestions , what they way we can do .
and that would allow us very good to help .
i <unk> me now , time for their engagement and we see us out hope .
and then scan you the code .
i just , it .
many have the phone , not in the hand .
you so i 'm become , or what ?
okay .
thank you .

chapter one .
if i <unk> is my head empty .
so abandoned like the sheet , that he now to fill it 's trying .
yes , and i 'm not come .

yes , yeah .
it makes fun , you .
yes , 'n sentence .
the is in <unk> written .
it 's a very long sentence .
i think it 's almost impossible , <unk> in <unk> to explain , is the point .
here , a text .
this day is a <unk> .
is the title , from the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he has it already know , before i do it as such <unk> .
he has to me <unk> of a up , then would he told me <unk> .
i could make me later , in him <unk> .
i told him the joy .

with a <unk> <unk> in the face where else ?
and intention , it 's not more to honor , by i <unk> .
and should i later , back up , it , not to a going day i acted .

now it 's time for a little joke .
what i said to albert einstein , when he would be a steak , she ?
i q .
so .
the letter q sounds like the cow .
so that 's funny .
yes , the text , has also the paper , her learned .
is more what political .
so , i write , not just fun things .
i write , also partially very political stuff .
and it 'll ' i often wondered , where i <unk> .
and , yes , i ' i just this text message here is written .
he 's wearing the title <unk> .
my dad came from vienna , in my mother and i 'm from her .
yes .
we have the <unk> .
thank you for the sound .
yes , of the <unk> ' i 'd like a bit of advertising .
i can tell me , no business or so afford , so i have to that always <unk> do .
and it <unk> ' i also ourselves events and i <unk> also ourselves a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
you can actually like time i show up .
and yes , i <unk> ' , i <unk> , actually very <unk> .
and , yeah .
that you want ' i just have said .
it goes on the program .
more advertising .
this is a little advertising , i time i wrote that i .
feet .
rich , vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin toe .
already , very funny .
i want , a joke about the <unk> your girlfriend , writing , but the same punchline that was just a flat .
yes , is not degrees , my <unk> .
<unk> you have to stop the <unk> <unk> <unk> you have to make the <unk> out of it .
yes .
thank you for a 's listening .
you were great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me tell you the same with a <unk> question .
why do you <unk> at all do ?
i think , everybody , the tax it should , asking , if he least some potentially of society , what back .
the answer is very clear .
we know now , the life , at the birth , just to about <unk> percent of genetically <unk> is .
that means it has to any environmental , <unk> give the impact on <unk> .
why we know yet , so little ?
why are we 've been bombarded by the <unk> messages from the <unk> , the , the part of each disagree with ?
you remember , all , fifteen years to the <unk> .
it was fat .
you thought , if you fat from the food <unk> , we all <unk> and be healthy , old .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves , with different <unk> in the american <unk> led , and what 's nothing that changed , the americans every year 's thicker become .
then , you have said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it are the carbs .
then what to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and so on the .
it 's so again and <unk> new <unk> sow through it 's the village <unk> .
where the whole <unk> ?
now , the reason is , for my taste , the least , we go through <unk> <unk> approaches <unk> <unk> to science and wisdom <unk> .
typical for a <unk> <unk> is here .
the <unk> you know of all .
<unk> published a lot <unk> magazine , a new <unk> .
the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for the next year .
keith richards , was seven years for the place one nominated vice versa .
then he died on the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest person , shows ever attempted on the earth , lived .
<unk> years old .
i know , there 's somewhere , people , say , they are six , but just your <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> .
and they stopped with <unk> on to smoke and started , but with <unk> again , to then finally , with <unk> <unk> the path of the virtue to follow and stop to smoke .
with <unk> is then you have died .
what she tells us that ?
not , cigarettes , healthy .
but it tells us , aging , very complicated is , and that we need clean , statistics , we need an easy experimental systems and we need to the simple questions .
<unk> very simple question , and a very simple <unk> , in different countries <unk> is women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it now .
this is the testosterone , <unk> so , in the male <unk> produced is .
and there 's <unk> very simple evidence for <unk> men are right , as old women .
can now everybody for , think if that a <unk> <unk> is .
austria 's a free land .
but it come still better tips , not afraid .
general , shall we 've got correlation , <unk> to confuse it .
sounds complicated , but it 's just , the usual <unk> to illustrate .
there we visited so somebody <unk> <unk> grandma , and asks , what you have because so different made , or another way eaten , so old become are ?
ah .
the she has every day , 10 cigarettes <unk> .
this is probably the secret of their ages , right ?
and have the ten cigarettes , maybe just not <unk> .
or , but they have <unk> and the she would be without the ten cigarettes , older .
ourselves hard statistics are not always <unk> .
there for instance , <unk> very hard statistics , shows that people , the <unk> in the <unk> to get older , when people , that does n't do .
<unk> .
is <unk> .
is that , the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it is that the people just enough money in the bag have to , well , to her age , and the <unk> diseases to take care .
if i but a group of <unk> a <unk> to forage give and this group with 20 percent longer lives as <unk> group , the <unk> just ca n't get , but otherwise , right in that was then i actually probably a <unk> factor in the diet by .
and actually are these attempts done .
to tell you , the <unk> is very <unk> at but even i do with my enemies agree that i 'm is that <unk> fast that life <unk> .
and that works for the different organisms .
the example , bacteria .
you see here <unk> <unk> of bacteria .
if we the fast , in the <unk> line that then life , the longer .
the same for <unk> , <unk> flying over mice and recently was just ago about two years in the u.s. has shown that 's even for the monkey is true .
and it 's not about , skinny .
it 's also , <unk> the <unk> kitchen .
and that 's a another experiment , in the united states was done .
what , you did here ?
you has <unk> <unk> taken and has the a bit like this so-called <unk> administered to a <unk> diet , where you so many <unk> here day and night , has .
and who you wonder , the mice are wonderfully thick and become the sick and have <unk> very bad <unk> had and bad <unk> .
now , you <unk> parallel <unk> taken and the has the right at the same amount of <unk> fed up just that <unk> <unk> break .
the have the day is not about food to , for you have at twice as much eating .
and this <unk> now is <unk> and healthy and they also has no <unk> .
though , both of mice <unk> does .
both have in a much eating .
the a sick and the other healthy .
what happened there really ?
it 's a process called the cellular <unk> or <unk> on .
when , and they were organisms , or the cells , food taken away then you start the organism , <unk> ingredients in the cell or degraded ingredients in them to turn it again , energy .
that makes sense .
and that looks like this .
you can see , in the cell , it , <unk> form of to <unk> , during the ages <unk> .
the <unk> then with the stomach , the ingredients to <unk> and the cell as energy back to get asked .
it will just damage the age , accumulate in the borders that .
this is it that molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> often tell .
so , to it so <unk> fast <unk> that live in different organisms .
and it 's probably , to that 's also , people work .
and we learn from this is that they just not like in <unk> recommended , every little <unk> the day with two <unk> fight to .
no .
but , they should , say , if you 're hungry , have , ah , maybe it 's just the <unk> on .
welcome you your hunger , as a friend .
and that makes it also <unk> sense .
while <unk> point where nine , nine percent of human history has the human , what did , if he was hungry , i mean ?
right , he 's a hunting gone .
we go out regularly , the fridge , hunting , if we 're hungry .
and that 's safe against the biology .
now we know , and that 's already in the bible , in <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is : , but the meat is weak .
the garden like for us very different from .
here , of <unk> <unk> in a medieval the garden that .
the three <unk> here 's good , the food , all day , let me , also .
and that 's sort of the real <unk> .
we therefore on the search , substances made the molecular answer the <unk> turn , although the organism , eats .
this could for people 's interesting to be , whose <unk> not enough just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it could we may , one of the hardest <unk> of life to preserve .
so the question is we can the <unk> , the <unk> , the cellular <unk> turn , although you eat ?
and we have many hundreds , the thousand substances scans , natural substances .
we have in the fact , found that means <unk> .
<unk> is a real substance , in all of organisms , naturally is the but also in all of organisms , during the <unk> less will .
in the skin , it 's the <unk> .
<unk> people have been the less <unk> in the skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells to give , for example , then you see here .
this is <unk> <unk> cell .
is the <unk> , the nucleus , we give <unk> on and we see many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell of the <unk> , during the ages <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells were very , look like .
and that works in different organisms .
here for instance , shown in a <unk> .
so we have <unk> substance we found the molecular <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
life , because the organisms that , no longer .
and the answer is again , you see here <unk> typical <unk> of <unk> .
it are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days are the all dead , of days is about the half of dead .
when , and we <unk> the water be , here in her colorful , the animals grow and survive better .
we also know , human cells , we of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have in culture , about three , for survival , if we do you with <unk> putting it .
and the latest research on , too close that even the lives of all over mice , <unk> <unk> will .
and it 's not only that life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are clearly <unk> .
so .
now you want to say , all know , where it comes <unk> ago ?
how the name , says , it 's the sperm being discovered was , it comes in very high concentrations .
but i can you <unk> , also in <unk> fresh green pepper mushrooms cheese , and a product from <unk> <unk> , in japan , <unk> <unk> , that 's <unk> <unk> 's very much <unk> ago .
we then , if <unk> against <unk> helps , by it the <unk> <unk> it then you might also , <unk> ?
they have to find is know that the common denominator of all <unk> diseases is that during the ages <unk> in the brain <unk> .
and we have in the did experiments that .
they 're going to wonder , we have the , flies .
flies to find is also <unk> , if you 're old .
they have more <unk> in the brain , if you 're old .
and the molecular mechanisms , for memory of these are are very much like the people .
now you ask , yet , how to the devil has the guy , the memory of flies of ?
this is the experiment , what we put together with stefan these of the university berlin 've done .
you take a hundred flies and put the here , there , which is a smell , they love .
<unk> .
and let the , in this <unk> <unk> .
then take you the same fly to give you in the next chamber , and give them <unk> other smell , they love , which <unk> .
we do you make the <unk> enjoy , while , but <unk> <unk> <unk> .
classical <unk> .
then take you again , the same fly , do the here in .
the drive here 's degree in the <unk> down , there you the .
and if you down here which are going to give you of a side <unk> and of other side <unk> .
where they go to the all to ?
i realized .
to <unk> .
except the two here .
these are the <unk> .
or , we say , they have the character .
i love my <unk> and i let 's ' i 'm not by so <unk> <unk> reward <unk> .
okay .
but it 's <unk> form of character , with the age increases .
not just at flying .
and we could actually the <unk> the fly through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , to go back to bring .
and the <unk> , in the brain that were , were back by .
that means , <unk> does n't just against the aging , but also , <unk> diseases , some .
and that 's important , because we want yes , the <unk> not the lifespan , by se prolong life .
it does n't make sense , the time the <unk> to prolong life .
and i want you ca n't get them , without them , time a few practical tips to do we think we have some younger .
still time <unk> fast .
it 's not about that you weight down or so .
there 's the way now in austria <unk> group of <unk> people , a day , eats , and a day , do n't eat .

and the keep the very well , through .
that means , it 's <unk> .
and avoid they <unk> .
it 's not to carbs , complex carbs seem to do n't be dangerous .
it 's really to take candy .
you know now , <unk> <unk> are to diabetes <unk> , even then if you <unk> .
and you know , the sugars that growth of tumors accelerate .
here you <unk> <unk> , the years ago , to ages .
after 30 days are the all dead .
very low doses of glucose to .
to a <unk> effect to create .
there 's just an example , that works in almost all these organisms that .
food they regularly fruits and vegetables .
and avoid , the gift of to a lot <unk> or of <unk> at all .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer can .
this is not under the circumstances for them vitamin d .
we 're here some degrees ' in a <unk> , because vitamin d is dominated by sunlight on the skin , educated .
some you least three times per week <unk> half hour of sports , that 's really trivial .
cigarettes , despite the <unk> <unk> examples of you <unk> 10 to fifteen years lifetime .
do you in times the eternal <unk> occasionally the quiet .
the impact of praying , and blood pressure on the life expectancy is shows .
because the monks of lives almost so long , how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> life is still no longer than <unk> .
just <unk> die from earlier than <unk> .
what is that ?
the people assume that has what do with some substances to do .
no way , no way that 's very simple .
if now here 's a <unk> the window is then <unk> ' i the with <unk> <unk> solution .
and what 's like that 's probably in your <unk> .
<unk> scaling , <unk> and so what , going through and alcohol , under the circumstances , there <unk> .
so , alcohol , all <unk> <unk> effect .
a permanent partner , or <unk> family is , longevity associated with .
they should n't , a lot of the busiest street to live .
now you think in <unk> .
that , but with <unk> n't have to do .
it 's going to <unk> .
you can measure the closer to someone , a lot of the busiest street in the type , <unk> more <unk> , he said in the blood .
and that 's also , when he says , i time on used .
i can already well sleep and the noise that makes me anything .
not true .
he has yet , more <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .
sun radiation to <unk> be because <unk> course .
we know now , <unk> very good metabolic effects .
ago all , it can the <unk> down .
and we also know that <unk> and <unk> mice , against the infectious to protect .
that we knew the way our grandmothers will also , the us with <unk> and so <unk> .
it 's not without any sense .
of studies to give the dark chocolate , dementia <unk> that can .
just recently is a study <unk> , has shown that <unk> half the board of dark chocolate , a day , the <unk> one <unk> on the level of <unk> bring can .
like suspected that you of coffee , here 's the at but it thinner .
there 's studies , that show , there 's studies , that does n't show .
what is clear is that coffee , diabetes <unk> it and their metabolic performance better .
and a coffee is the way , a good <unk> because he solves <unk> , how we put together with <unk> <unk> of paris to show you could .
<unk> very beautiful and intricate study in the hundred thousand people to fifteen years for a study were have shown that people , every day <unk> handful of nuts to eat their <unk> to 20 percent down .
this is a huge value for <unk> <unk> study .
and this is true for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not for the peanuts , the <unk> seen , beans .
the give just , by , you nuts to call , okay ?
that are , but actually , beans .
so for the peanuts is n't that .
the next thing is a little <unk> .
and avoid , the shot of to a lot of animal protein , so of meat and dairy , but only , if you between <unk> and <unk> years old .
<unk> very beautiful new study shows you to , if you in this <unk> to a lot of animal protein to , take you <unk> so strong increase , as if you a strong smokers , would .
this is not for the time after , where the animal proteins are good and it 's true of course not for <unk> children or a juvenile , the animal protein will need and it is not for pregnant and those , it will want .
general , and avoid they <unk> .
what 's also , they do to remain they <unk> that you know , friedrich nietzsche , has said , <unk> , the <unk> , that <unk> mistrust the <unk> are signs of the health .
all <unk> heard in the pathology lab .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> the has about after that regime that lived and he 's <unk> years old .
he comes from my home <unk> of the <unk> , is never get sick .
and he 's very good .
he 's just not <unk> <unk> not an anecdote , but he lives in a <unk> , where it 's particularly of healthy <unk> there .
he has about the <unk> followed , i do you today i said .
we should look at all the <unk> experiments <unk> important fact , but not only overlook .
which is that <unk> the <unk> me in not organic , but a social seems to be , and so , a <unk> .
you <unk> the old people less , and that could one of the <unk> make our culture .
<unk> wrote the biggest novel , the <unk> a year ago , his death .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece , the contemporary critic , all the adolescents fresh <unk> .
i thank you .
i want to start with a question , i them in .
a question , where now , no up to , because the is a little <unk> which of you who 's very lonely place ?
the <unk> is , very low .
less , when i thought .
it , but probably the reasons , why they 're not reported that have , also the people , that for , which it <unk> would .
many people confuse <unk> and loneliness and think that would <unk> .
and that 's not at all the case .
will see from loneliness is actually more like a phenomenon of people as alone .
maybe it 's because it also that they 're not reported that have , because the question , fuzzy fact is .
you feel you , lonely , or is you are lonely place ?
you can , lonely , feeling , without a lonely .
and you can be lonely , no , in the moment lonely having to feel .
loneliness that has also a great deal with a shame , to do .
also that 's some now here from have , to loneliness to <unk> .
loneliness that leads in a shame and shame , leads in loneliness .
loneliness takes time .
also why is , now here , no reported that have in the few seconds , which i do you gave .
loneliness to <unk> .
loneliness to the time to , of all aware .
and loneliness to also practice , to talk about to .
and this exercise to have we all do n't .
we have neither the language , we sign for us , to recognize when we are lonely place ?
there 's the loneliness to two <unk> , which i again and 're 'm .
the a part of humanity , says , you is from beginning , lonely .
of the birth to death is you actually just another lonely .
there 's a few moments in life where you that <unk> can .
these people go then , to <unk> and the steering , the day .
i ' no time , is so you <unk> .
and then there 's people might be less country , say , everything is with all connected .
that i there 's actually do n't , so , i 's just a part of the big universe .
and there 's the great group , to the i also am the time , , thinking .
the thinking , okay , today i a lonely and the next day , oh , it depends , all together .
if we , and loneliness to think falls within us , first of the very large loneliness is a a .
the loneliness the dying , and loneliness to the sick on one of intensive care .
but about this <unk> , about these big <unk> <unk> ' i am today is n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , about the mundane <unk> , where loneliness to us , in that 's a theater face .
i also do n't talk about the burden , and <unk> the <unk> .
loneliness at the other to realize it falls , mostly , not hard loneliness at us to <unk> already .
the photographer christine tailors , in the break a few pictures made , i show you want .
how easy it gives us , falls , in other , and loneliness to .
and we know , not , whether these people , really in this moment , lonely , have felt .
but who knows it 's not , the moment , so <unk> event , where you think , all talking together , you yourself is something lost in the corner and has anyone , <unk> .
this sudden <unk> loneliness to know the safe here all .
may have some of you today , already seen .
what you about it does , pulls the phone out very often , also that could you today , very good to see this is that <unk> , that <unk> the phone , an escape , the <unk> .
the visible , if you on the display , look .
what we now here is n't do .
yes , and then there 's the loneliness to the degrees , you sitting on the loneliness than one <unk> on <unk> stage , hundreds of <unk> faces of years ago , and you even something out in the hope that you , text , not forget .
these are the <unk> , you from the outside .
the we other people we ascribe them .
but i 'm sure , there 's here , people in the room , the , from birth , lonely , feel the all their lives for so i spent have , by showing you have tried to this loneliness of , <unk> , to distract ourselves .
and there 's in this room guaranteed , people the lonely , are , because they 're on a other people up to that 's because of death or because of separation .
there 's using it also not something that , so many people , also people , which they 're connected to you around you 're feeling , lonely .
and there 's people , have the terms to , lost , no contact with more to , and are so lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and sit down , her as the analog loneliness .
the analog loneliness is we 're familiar .
that are people , which after their opinion , it 's no , social contact .
also that 's always be relatively .
there 's not an official that number , no <unk> number , whenever somebody to human contact , when do n't .
we falls , right away the old people .
it 's the analog form of loneliness .
since we but all in cities live , connected with very many people at facebook or by twitter or facebook is this digital loneliness and bigger .
you can do with hundreds of people to be connected , without with a single people really connected to be .
it 's the analog loneliness to the quantity of human relationships , the missing is it at the digital loneliness to the quality of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness to be very often the other , <unk> .
that 's also that the analog loneliness a little <unk> <unk> .
whereas the digital loneliness , good works for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's kind of go out that the digital loneliness in the future , we gain is when the ways that , to connect , bigger .
i do n't know , if you in 20 years , this sense that the our from loneliness is very similar to be going to more loneliness to call it .
or whether you this , and then a new term , .
but that are also , the problems of <unk> generation .
almost more than the loneliness to itself is the fear , of loneliness and from this fear , of loneliness that are people are some related to get ready .
<unk> , the big <unk> , also a <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in the of you , what people do everything to do n't alone .
they build cathedrals , they were witnesses children , then again , lonely , are and alone .
but that <unk> has n't you named the fear , of loneliness to figure out , which money to spend .
<unk> go .
these things that 's .
both the process over , the loneliness , because it at least in short run a touch with that when i also the objects themselves , you were acquired .
the problem is just that 's very short , help and holding , this one of those potions against the loneliness .
so we have to again and new things to buy us new <unk> .
i ' time the advertising for a a <unk> panties label .
and the <unk> , very , <unk> of your communications , with the slogan be <unk> of it .
what that the panties , to do , i know you do n't , but apparently it 's also that .
loneliness that has so anything with the <unk> to do loneliness to find out of people , so instead .
<unk> <unk> has a wonderful poem written , and there is a verse , but the worst is the loneliness to <unk> .
hand on a 's heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship up or the or the other , <unk> to watch and , suddenly , awful , just to feel , awful lonely having to feel and the question to ask , who is this person actually ?
i ' i , even something to do ?
a study of saying that , the <unk> women around the its , married , with kids , feel .
of missing , because i now , not more you know , if i the study , even invented have so often i ' i they told .
but it 's also now completely different matter because it at least in studies , mostly care is , and the reaction , the same is that the people , i <unk> .
that intuitive , completely obvious is , almost , a <unk> .
loneliness to <unk> is any given too , and yet to talk , we 're not about you .
talk , so little bit about the loneliness to sex .
also that has probably already , everybody had .
now , while you <unk> is , suddenly , to think , what do , i 'm here 's really ?
who is this person in my bed , really ?
also that a form of loneliness that are not what to have to deal with the quality of sexual <unk> .
also have nothing to do have to deal with the quality of relationship .
they just is always there .
we speak only not about you , because we do n't you look .
we speak only , not about you in the workforce .
in the workforce is the loneliness is also <unk> when we think .
i stood <unk> on so <unk> <unk> and i noticed a group of five <unk> , better , three carried suit and two carried costume either .
the two men have , having the two women in a costume -- have , a conversation .
and in between was something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in the hand , the <unk> .
i think , i have to you the scene n't even further out with you this shape of loneliness that everybody 's also , time in the workforce has experienced , again <unk> .
it 's the loneliness the <unk> .
it 's , but also the loneliness the <unk> .
we know all the <unk> or i see , sit here might also a couple of the their lives <unk> , <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> in the hotels , in <unk> bars , often , do n't know more , who they actually are , what they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
also that 's a form of loneliness to the n't talked to .
just so it 's also <unk> , how much more loneliness than <unk> abused can be .
down here is insulation .
i has time a <unk> told that he 'd been from a client , and the has said , it 's what , then happened , you can do it you do n't imagine .
a <unk> was just in the lunchroom .
so , he , to <unk> would .
and two months later , he 's also have stepped out .
the loneliness that 's never been alone so .
they come , in the connection with other feelings .
she has a sibling and they have ugly , sibling .
the ugly siblings , we all .
fear , sadness in despair anger and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful siblings , not forget .
the freedom of the proud of the desire that <unk> .
so my plea to look , you the loneliness .
come and it 's in life as the tide , and a flood .
let you , and let you do n't of you are .
because there 's still something much worse than the loneliness and this is the empty , maybe , of loneliness that comes when you do n't even more feel .
loneliness is part of life .
since i 'm so hard about loneliness thinking have to have , for me two things .
, in my <unk> the <unk> i 'm not even more like a <unk> dictator since i realized i realized that i only then always somebody who 'd have why he , not raise because i would have maybe i 'm losing i the people , maybe i 'll ' i lonely .
let me , it 's been able , since i the loneliness in my life accepted have people come and go to .
exactly like this is it with the <unk> , you so it .
also , i a free .
people come and go to let me , they do n't even more immediately , who , whether , from a close encounter a friendship , or at a partnership have could .
as a child i found my parents were incredibly embarrassing .
the can , any <unk> by without with someone a conversation start .
whether in the <unk> or in the economy .
every time led it to an unending conversations .
as a child i found that as i said , embarrassing .
as young adult , i they 're incredibly for <unk> that to can this openness to have .
but first since i myself , with the loneliness too have to make it me at least to and again , i also <unk> so to open .
you see it 's and lonely be called , willing to do for the performance .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i , here three seem .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now <unk> ' i , if you just once access <unk> which <unk> would you take ?
the most people would , for the <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we do with the least effort , the biggest effect of getting .
at health , we do this kind of different .
there 's we the activity with the biggest effect , completely out of eight and choose to us for other strategy .
we choose to us , for example for the <unk> and the is for sports .
big <unk> but big effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we choose to us for the <unk> .
the is for diet .
also very large <unk> but still very big effort .
for me so , not so valuable .
and i want you today about how you with the least effort , the biggest <unk> getting .
if you , with hiv prevention and health , too , come you to a topic , not a drum around .
and this issue is overweight .
and the subject of obesity , was in germany , long time , no issue , so , until the <unk> .
and then she the number overweight , in germany and strong .
and i wondered , there was going on the <unk> ?
why was that <unk> suddenly , up ?
and then i research and i 'm also <unk> .
because it was right in the years <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> , germany .
and we 're going and thicker ?
and i went on at .
<unk> comes <unk> , germany .
and that obesity , up .
and the years <unk> take the still time , right , the journey on .
and what 's coming then , germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how all that means .
and we 're going and thicker ?
well , i was one , and one <unk> .
because it was , yes , right .
sports , thick .
and of course <unk> ' i am today , not here , to tell you , sports and dick and power .
because that 's not true .
but one , we now in common that .
the flood of , new training -- and <unk> has not to run by that we <unk> and healthier .
what it 's so then ?
the diet ?
and also there 's <unk> very great study of the united states .
also the have the problem with obesity .
and they have in the <unk> <unk> introduced .
and then they wanted to just after that look , what happened there really ?
and they 've seen the people take in fact , less fat on , but the people take , and fewer calories on , but anyway , thicker bit .
and that was the paradox .
and so you have it <unk> called .
we can you that explain why ?
there to you the body as a power , imagine .
there we have here , <unk> big <unk> .
and the a side , it 's a <unk> , do we all the <unk> on the be here is burned .
and here is the energy <unk> when electricity .
if we now , but more <unk> here in be in our power as we on the other use <unk> , the energy in the power and it does <unk> .
the human body does n't in <unk> .
the can the energy to store .
and it in the form of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happens , but if we are fewer such as we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> , here the energy and then it 's just a conclusion to .
the <unk> , dramatically it .
here you do n't live more of .
we 're yes , just , mobile .
and exactly that 's happening .
our grandparents are <unk> , 20 kilometers to walk gone .
and we come today degrees , on a to two miles and are the positive estimates .
there 's studies , the report of five -- until <unk> feet .
i <unk> , you that still something <unk> with my friend mike , tell .
give you leave me degrees ' the chair ?
mike , come to you degrees ' time ?
mike 's americans .
he 's really shy , he 's not a lot to talk .
and he was at this trial and sitting now here .
he 's this typical <unk> <unk> , jeans <unk> <unk> and he has a <unk> in the hand .
and mike eats , less and , less and takes only still <unk> , and yet he will and thicker bit .
why ?
because that mike 's only still sitting .
and i did the time i watched , how much more movement , mike , the day , and i told him , a step counter the back in the bag into and at night i went back <unk> .
and there stood on a thousand steps .
that was so the distance , mike at has the morning , from the kitchen , the car with the car into the office there , a coffee out and night coming back .
and he came on a thousand steps .
that means that mike , was , that day 10 minutes on his legs .
<unk> hours and its minutes i was mike , or was mike .
under those conditions of disease of america alone .
and mike 's not so , dick , because he wants to be much eating , because so long , he up again and energy <unk> , but not uses he will inevitably must always thicker , and the energy <unk> .
and the first <unk> , the energy , as you see here , his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> , there is not there .
the <unk> , some stage back in <unk> blood .
and also there is they 're actively and <unk> still , and quiet , his <unk> .
so the blood sugar .
so if , the energy <unk> the blood , you 're talking about the doctors of high blood and high <unk> .
and that sugar , the <unk> there 's like <unk> , does all the little black holes in this <unk> .
and a very lucky , floating in there , the fat around and that <unk> , well , these little wounds and we speak of <unk> or <unk> .
and now comes <unk> heart right under pressure , because now to he the blood , by these tight <unk> pots pumps and we talk from high .
and if this high , then on that 's a <unk> true , it 's also in the body <unk> .
and if that the heart to happen , then we call the heart attack .
and if that the head happens then we call the stroke .
and also in germany , and dies every second , heart attacks and the stroke .
that means , in germany , and dies every second , <unk> .
and also mike 's so not so sick , because he did n't a sports , drives , but because he , does n't even more moved .
and if you , what do n't know , for you always , the wrong .
for the subject of diet .
i have degrees ' yesterday , a diet , amazon entered and there are coming <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , now .
and if each book , just like a few inches thick and this is , and we were going to the here <unk> , we have a 30 feet high tower current <unk> <unk> .
and i 've got the time for you all read .
and there 's inside and this is now , really important if you more energy in so more food as they use , then you going to thick .
and if you less energy in when they use , then you going to thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need to <unk> books ?
that makes just a conclusion to .
that need of course , is huge , but <unk> is to do n't help .
because why she fails , a diet , to a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet is , and not a lifestyle .
what from the things , we here , three weeks to make and here , five weeks , if we then , after this struggle , again in the normal life back , to our normal lifestyle .
what is then , after five or seven weeks ago ?
nothing .
except <unk> and again , <unk> in the confidence that we again , not that have made , what we <unk> .
so to you ab now , every new diet , at each new <unk> questions , and you want that in their day-to-day , in your lifestyle , into .
yes or no ?
and if yes , then <unk> .
and if no , you make it just stay .
because if the end n't come out , it 's pure time .
it are the habits , about to decide whether we 're sick , or a healthy .
it are the bad habits , we get sick .
and it are the good behavior , of us healthy .
and if mike in the mirror at then you see that he was there the result of everyday lifestyle .
if mike in the mirror at , what he was there , everyday habits .
and if mike in the mirror at and honest , to , is , what he also , where he way .
because when he 's more bad habits , as good , then he 's just in the disease that way .
and if mike , in the direction to the health towards its goals , towards its dreams , then to he did n't immediately be whole life <unk> .
then we need he just enjoying more good behavior as bad .
and a , <unk> habits , mike 's also a great example of that that the person , a weird animal is .
mike , it for instance , did , movement is completely from his life <unk> by he every way with the car <unk> any <unk> uses , every lift , using .
and night is he <unk> the couch and to somehow <unk> again , movement to come .
so down , he said , in his <unk> <unk> into your gym there with the <unk> after the top of what is yes , by se , paradox is , and will then how so <unk> rat , again , so a band <unk> , so he somehow , again , movement .
and my grandpa , , right , <unk> as you .
the was a farmer and the have that did n't understand .
the have said , sport is for people the , not move .
and somehow , he also , right .
why we have to night in our most precious time , that to compensate for what we in life <unk> have ?
<unk> and we have today , this <unk> lifestyle , two hours of sports and make a day .
and about , but very much easier to the movement , again , there to find where we do you have lost .
in life .
and so <unk> ' i do you today to a perspective invite you .
maybe you know , you the situation , you <unk> night , times more quickly , shopping and i 've , in the front row — no room for free .
and that you look like , programmed into this <unk> in us .
we want to always the shortest because they go .
we 're planning our apartments , so that we the <unk> ways .
we 're planning our whole life , that we the <unk> ways , but that leads us , but not there , where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
so to you ab now the <unk> activate and the movement , again , finding , where they degrees up .
i figured out , for example , like with the orbit .
and i 'm the only , always come up and down and up and down there 's and all other .
but when i yet , time , i 'm then <unk> ' i but the time for me .
then <unk> ' i but the movement is a , there 's just like around is .
and if of up the <unk> coming , 30 minutes <unk> , say , i <unk> .
<unk> steps .
that are about three times 10 minutes , translated it .
and a , <unk> <unk> steps , if you ab now , every day <unk> steps more to go then that mean , the end of the day 12 gram of fat , not in your body <unk> .
that may be relatively little sound .
but as <unk> , as a habit established , time <unk> days in the year , then talk , we of four point five pounds fat .
the we 're not in our bodies .
and you give me degrees ' time this , i <unk> , it always <unk> .
the americans are yes crazy , imagine that 's what here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
are think , i had four pounds .
just so you time you see , what happened there with these little steps .
and if that the effect is from this perspective , my you , just happened , if you really in an active life to start .
and this <unk> the get you ab now , every day in their day-to-day .
once you , <unk> steps per day , which are , walk you virtually all <unk> .
and if you then got and have time , sports and then they do that on top .
then you have to the <unk> also , <unk> .
then you will also , and stronger .
but do with you your health , not more dependent on behalf of sports .
so they make your health , not more dependent on of like , and of their time .
because the most important that most important that they do now , every day as a lifestyle .
and i <unk> ' a active lifestyle <unk> .
and for me , it 's now more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a <unk> that on a clear that decision based on for the life and for me .
because i think , health has not to do with , what we should do , or do have .
but health has to do with , what we want to do .
and so <unk> ' i am today only , the idea for them .
you decide , ab now , just , for the best .
and ab now you know , how it 's .
step for one step .
thank you very much .
<unk> how it has a leonardo , da vinci , actually managed , so incredible , <unk> kind and in the world with other eyes to see ?
and , so far on the <unk> what to his time just simply unthinkable to unimaginable was ?
we could something like today , ?
now , that maybe what do with <unk> to do ?
and how we can turn it force and confidence for our future draw ?
we start , but the time , with the question what we understand , under the innovation ?
i realized .
technology invention of research and development , even the official <unk> the federal government has the title <unk> the federal government .
so , me , right .
this is yes , all the great .
and we can with quite proud to be , and be grateful that we <unk> in such a lot of fields are that our <unk> around the world to be that 's us well , about .
that we do with a so extraordinary , unique , wealth have evolved .
but look like it with the future of ?
the challenges , because there as a society based on us to ?
and who cares about , because there to the big ecological and social challenges ?
so <unk> , it 's kind <unk> .
a kind of division .
so the economy of care , the ecological challenges , because the entrepreneur and then a big effort with the we then productivity and efficiency up .
and the the world better we want to make the find , in the nonprofit organizations and together and <unk> and the need to then also what companies , so the main thing <unk> course , then the damage the capitalist in the economy to remove themselves .
at least <unk> to fix .
but who says , because that we all this as well , separated at to ?
how would it because if we <unk> to <unk> social and cultural dimension to expand faster ?
if technological innovation , the same time , cultural innovation are ?
if the economic innovations , the same time , social innovation are ?
if it gives us even leaders , thinking and act , sent into with the solution of big environmental and social challenges ?
if it very different people have an unknown forces <unk> and if it gives us even a very different , fair <unk> development 'm going ?
because as i was that ?
both sides to but what companies , right ?
can that work ?
ask you may come .
so far we have that yes , as a contradiction way .
, there 's encouraging examples .
muhammad yunus , with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh creepy , much does the poverty , there <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more just in direct <unk> to the what the government <unk> done .
and he has <unk> as entrepreneurs , i realized that the nobel <unk> .
the opportunity , drops to me , i <unk> ' they still with anyone familiar to do .
allow , can i imagine <unk> <unk> .
'n very <unk> young guy .
great trained , , but also its ideals from .
and yes , so , <unk> .
i like the , like .
and if you the see , then you think oh really , the offspring , we need to us to our future , yes n't worry .
yes , the same , and after the studying , he then , somewhere here we started to work at a our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that does he also very good .
that they like him , and there 's also very successful .
and yet , anything is there 's still so in him .
so he asks , there 's not still more , that somehow encoded in me is ?
so this the entrepreneurial , he says , then always .
<unk> are yes , in all <unk> .
and that they like him .
and he would like , these <unk> .
so the right there 's also the <unk> , the , he is in and recognized .
so not that he made it personally , you know , but the <unk> tells him the , what .
and there , in the middle of the t , three n , i knew he did n't .
so , <unk> more he was surprised when the him , then the <unk> personally imagined was .
as well , mister <unk> .
and as 'n experienced the entrepreneurs , he , then there is that imagined .
the 's great pleasure for , so with young people together , there , his experience <unk> .
and the two , then to like each other .
and have , more hit .
how would it because if we now , in a of those conversations from the two times <unk> ?
yes , mister <unk> , so how it was that because again , right .
what is now , the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> company ?
that i still not so , understood .
yes , so , <unk> then we start , but the time , the question what 's 'n <unk> company ?
so the name says , yeah .
established markets , established products , established customers , established structures , there 's a <unk> .
and you can also quite right at the ab give , where , the big one <unk> .
and time <unk> <unk> <unk> , also if the very neat is can that 's also .
what 's because then actually a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you <unk> , so one , it 's time i guarantee you do n't it 's exactly what 's not the small copy of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it has yes , a completely other character .
because it has <unk> nothing <unk> .
no <unk> customers , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
of why is a <unk> a an organization , the purpose to serve a business to go , to find , to the profitable it 's the course , but , all <unk> is , and , then scale it .
and you 'll be safe to understand that 's lots of course , so <unk> organization , very different very different ways of thinking there , very different <unk> , very different ways .
yes , that 's me , right .
but after what they 're looking for , because actually ?
so , i <unk> ' time , then it 's <unk> there 's the drum as <unk> <unk> money to make or ?
so i ' there 's also a degree , that fits very well , so 'n seminar i found in berlin , would you me that would recommend it ?
that means <unk> .

oh no .
really <unk> ?

so <unk> you then a career as passive <unk> or what ?
what happens then with your commitment , i do you know ?
and also , we 're going to look , but the time the <unk> .
so the statistics about <unk> give you do n't <unk> perspective , because seventy percent of <unk> are very few years , then in a much worse financial situation when , her big .
money is always the outcome of a successful company , and one good <unk> company .
, money is a solar energy source for <unk> <unk> .
and it the basis of all of economic <unk> .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , what is then the goal ?
the company ?
so , when i do get ' i , but i learned , so without the goal is no way the right .
and so , goals to , and more concrete measurable time determines , and so forth .
and when i all that there 's not i ' , so that as i can see something for the i do n't know what i go to ?
so that makes me do n't feel good .
so how to because there to decide , and risks to this feels , for me all so very vague , and <unk> .
yes , <unk> welcome the <unk> .
but i ' there might wonder what for you .
a thread .
so the is yes , <unk> , so almost , secret .
successful <unk> of generation to generation <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , or how she says , you today ?
<unk> think , i , <unk> ?
so we say <unk> always <unk> .
, for crisis and <unk> and <unk> sustainable uncertainty .
so it is guaranteed .
i think ' , i can you have a little bit of leave .
okay .
yes , thank you , mister <unk> .
but there are yes , just ask it .
that can you , the same time you a the important <unk> qualities that 's good questions to imagine .
we can the time , after the other through them , the perhaps better understand ?
so the first is what i am here and what i want to do here to do ?
yes , <unk> , there 's <unk> what moves you that , you , beyond the greater is when you yourself ?
what <unk> you the world ?
what have the people of them , if you with you work ?
what you are willing to be ?
what are your inner , maybe , yes , unconscious <unk> ?
why is that 's so important , to see ?
because that are also your <unk> <unk> .
and how we have that of learned ?
if you a ship to build you want to then <unk> not the men together into parts of a hot , you , wood to collect , but i teach you , desire and after the of , an unending sea .
yes , well .
so then look , i time to me the next questions .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
what that mean , because it ?
yes , <unk> now do you your goal really time <unk> .
colorful <unk> in detail , colorful , but i <unk> , you in a few years ago , if you <unk> , what you do n't want to then it will , you on .
know , you actually the story with the pink and elephants ?
it falls to me , there 's degree .
not ?
<unk> .
so , pass one time on .
<unk> you , not a pink and elephants .
okay ?
it does it already ?
so no pink and elephants .
did ?
no pink and elephants .
see you ?
so it 's us , if we so on to focus on that , what we do n't want .
what is there 's actually the only way ?
there 's about <unk> ?
yes , , <unk> , you that ago , what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the <unk> the <unk> .
but <unk> , you <unk> ago .
the way , what i just thing you like , <unk> right ?
i , you , there , brought .
look time , if you the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in this room <unk> lord smith .
who ?
at <unk> <unk> <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a , <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> lady smith .
oh , but you ♫ but <unk> <unk> you <unk> ?
madam as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you one <unk> adversity <unk> <unk> <unk> may is out .
<unk> from <unk> .
it 's <unk> a , <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> you ?
and <unk> look like it comes from ?
is you what i noticed ?
, something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower , too .
okay .
so , you look , but the time , then look , where the bear with this is .
and action .
<unk> <unk> in this room <unk> lord smith .
who ?
at <unk> <unk> <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a , <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> lady smith .
and <unk> the way that 's you that ?
so , i still , i was also be shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i the first time , i .
i thought it ca : yes , not was to be .
and still much more in shock , i was as me through the head into this is it might be that i really all the time , by the area over ?
by my life .
and okay , i yes , that makes yes , meaning .
to pick up there 's the immediate <unk> to prevent that we the most of our perception and our <unk> first <unk> .
but what 's because now actually , ?
what <unk> ' i was , and what <unk> ' i 'm from ?
and so <unk> to realize you , your perception is specific , somewhere <unk> to , is <unk> more important entrepreneurial quality .
well , yes , thank you , then we come , but the time to the next question .
how i could actually to my goal to come ?
so , that i think <unk> good question .
that <unk> ' i , which every time , and i know that somehow not on going forward .
yes , <unk> , there 's <unk> good news for you .


almost automatically .
you 're going to do n't really differently , when that a brainstorming , you 're going to make things on you to .

and still <unk> question i recommend that i do you , of the look , you , well , , if you have could who you to the advice of questions could , there more input , more at with home to get .
and you 've also a model .
the <unk> have the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , if the n't even more on to know , the in his <unk> invited in florence .
so , for lunch , the famous one big table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , a banker , traders , engineers , architects and he has <unk> very intense <unk> clean .
but not in our of the sense , where it 's drum , i went , yes , who sit down , through ?
who has been right ?
but rather to that suddenly become of these different <unk> things that are the so on any kind of the way of which by themselves have to come up .
well , yes , the next question is what the concrete , the next step i doing ?
<unk> there are doing , let 's successful entrepreneur in the reason that simple .
instead of the big to plan , and management and so on you , just the next step .
because what should you , because in the area of uncertainty , do ?
but the lead this very determined and with all the consequence of .
and if it 's and then nothing was well , dan , for you <unk> <unk> another one step .
and even if the big , colorful <unk> <unk> nothing was then there 's <unk> <unk> other .
so it 's so important that you , your what is clear .
that there you , the inside of security .
and the way as we actually all running from ?
although we do that yes , it does n't know , and it , nobody has said ?
-- says , there 's also <unk> at the children .
so , this playful and learning , this for and this <unk> playful and it 's also , that it does that in a company is happening in a <unk> .
and that 's also , sort of that <unk> against the uncertainty , we have otherwise , so anxious .
yes , thank mister <unk> .
so that sounds , yes , very great .
but i do n't know , at me in the company , i think , there to , still a lot of bosses change that there anything happens .
and ourselves for here in germany , there 's always been so this gives a mood .
and i think ' , there have the politicians first to worry that , changes .
okay my boy , come on time with .
how to go here , down to the water .
what you think , many people can you change ?
10 ?
thousands of ?
ten million ?
look time here , down .
who see you ?
right , the .
this is the you change can , you really change can .
or to it , mahatma gandhi , to say , for the change , you in the world , looking in you yourself .
you think sure , beautiful words and big models , but how do that because it work ?
there we have , still 'n few <unk> on our <unk> .
helpful in all <unk> of crises , or if you to small , you feel for something or if you a <unk> <unk> and you 've all with you to do .
and if you in one of situations ask what i 'm you now despite all <unk> , you , which posture , you take you can physically , you , powerful to feel .
<unk> , you , but the time , what you , <unk> like , about the you just <unk> .

so i my , if it 's and you already happening is that , it at least worth it has .
yes .
mister <unk> .
and you think really to me that helps on my <unk> way ?
yes , right .
and realize you , all , two things .
first time the eighth place on the clarity of your inner <unk> , then to your <unk> what will .
because that determines your perception .
and , the eighth place on your inner attitude to you yourself to .
because it <unk> you like the other people , you to behave .
the future is always just then when we our own perception .
<unk> you that to ?
yes , i think , already .
thank mister <unk> well , then .
all good <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what would think they of our <unk> ?
nice .
really , or , <unk> ?
and how would think we 's because now , with this <unk> ?
this is a new <unk> ?
i mean , yeah .
very clear .
which i , all the <unk> see .
<unk> is to breathe <unk> .
and this is that , the <unk> really is .
a <unk> from potions for the euphoria .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
this is , but the <unk> .
the right now that country , long time in the big famous name <unk> .
from robert bosch , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> or how they all the hot .
let us , just this spirit of new to animate them .
and who knows , maybe is yes , from our <unk> the next leonardo at our time .
you 're right , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it would be so <unk> , i with kids and their future i 'm because finally , are yes , children , our future .
instead is that the view , i the most of time i enjoy .
i spend a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , have my father and i the program <unk> , entrepreneurship , for prisoners , who started .
we could qualify <unk> entrepreneurial , that means you can , after the custody , either on doing , or find after their <unk> easier to a workplace , they then also hold .
why <unk> i now , so out to <unk> , so who are already has failed are the big mistake i 've done ?
our program is a much not so easy to understand how to run the , kids care .
and honest , i said , i thought that the <unk> the last place in the universe is , in the i work would .
what you think , is the most lack of the childhood , with the people with which we work ?
we found out , it are positive models often the male , positive models .
and if you think about , why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> there are often is it that that the father 's no sensible work , that he -- that he 's drugs and consumed or that he ourselves in prison is .
and if then a <unk> young think about what he comes from his life to make , he may not better idea , as a different lives might look , because he was no better models .
and he <unk> his father .
i <unk> , you , martin , imagine .
martin 's <unk> our program .
his father was an alcoholic and made the whole family that live in the hell .
when he was 12 was is his mother died , and he and be a brother who had to the home .
there , he was the <unk> the great .
he was shy and <unk> and so the perfect victims .
to the day when i 'd be a brother , a game so roughly <unk> been is that the bottom are remained .
there <unk> , martin , first time , the <unk> through , he went on the enemy , go and proposed to .
and ab that day , he was respect .
and so it was going on .
violence was from now , to his life is exactly like in his father .
how it 's now , who , i just described -- i , on ?
after the childhood , the youth who are lots of unemployed or have <unk> .
you 're not a lot of other than your illegal activities and their <unk> <unk> .
and then you going to one day with people into prison , locked in which it 's exactly like this is , their thoughts , the same thing around the , no better models are .
about what , you think , you think of these people together , after , if you put together in prison are sitting right ?
mostly about not much good .
and they 're getting better criminals and in <unk> .
they sell and drugs on a higher level and plan , in custody , where you after the custody <unk> could .
and that then in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
that means , in germany will everybody <unk> second criminals and go back .
then there 's but also people in prison , the , really change want .
but also these people wear a <unk> the forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere , where they come , is that their first identity .
if you a work for , if you an apartment for me if you see new private relationships that we want to all you going to deal with this identity , with this <unk> faced , you a who in the society , infinitely hard power .
this is the problem , ago , we are .
how we 're trying to this problem to solve ?
the property , you think , bring a lot <unk> with ?
they would be surprised .
it are more entrepreneurial skills .
who 's a <unk> been building has , definitely know of <unk> , of <unk> and of <unk> .
the only the subject <unk> has a 's a little <unk> , anything about , he 's not in prison landed .
these characteristics we would like to for something positive use .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , in three <unk> .
we need to convey the basics of entrepreneurship and the economy .
everybody in write its own <unk> and everybody who takes , a getting <unk> part .
and then with we the people , after the custody at the <unk> , the <unk> the <unk> your personal relations and also , one of <unk> .
what for <unk> go there from our program to come out ?
it 's a great , bandwidth , from <unk> to the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> and <unk> .
a very big , bandwidth and to <unk> ' i do you 'd like <unk> imagine .
<unk> leaders talent and his illusion , is money to have him , very early , trade with the cocaine seduced .
he had always been fun thing that business to run .
he 's then <unk> for the first time arrested .
and this into custody , it 's not very impressed me .
, in the opposite .
he says ourselves now , he have at its second custody for .
<unk> is he then the second time convicted .
he took then you first , a therapy part and then the <unk> .
and there , i learned when he 'd like he would be the leaders talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september 13 let 's been , then october <unk> his agency for <unk> started .
the agency 's well , he can now of life .
he , very good <unk> worked .
he is today with me here .
who him to know , to talk , it .
still time back to martin , of the i told him to the start telling you had .
martin , after his childhood a training , chef of and ended up in his time in the <unk> <unk> .
and there , alcohol , and drugs , there , the agenda are was to cycle , quite quickly started .
he worked in parallel when a dj , and as <unk> .
20 years to he took this life .
and he says , today that he 's time with this lifestyle to do n't own consciousness in <unk> .
one day injured , he someone at a <unk> so hard that he then i was convicted .
he took the <unk> part and that <unk> there has really be life changed .
he learned , how he wants to more force to more success and to more quality , i could be without its <unk> to strive for or without drugs to consume .
and he was from his knowledge and so thrilled that he decided they had this to he likes to pass .
and he wanted to be part of the <unk> be .
that has <unk> .
he 's now been just two years at us and <unk> our collaborator on their way in the freedom , because he knows ourselves that , if you , really change to , and if you the right tools with , the hand , you get that much more possible that 's when you often i want .
the basis of these successes are the way people as you .
people , with us into prison , the to the external events , with us to come to our participants in their <unk> , at your personal plans to get .
that are our <unk> , the <unk> talks in our lessons to think that are the students at the <unk> do , <unk> the <unk> do .
and that are our mentors , our participants , right after the custody with .
and also these people take a very much of our program with .
one example .
we do on our events such a practice , the , <unk> called .
we stick and then in the middle of space is a big <unk> our participants are the , and our an stand on the other .
and i then , different questions .
and every time , if someone in space , this question , yes , answered that kick he , the line .
and here shows , what we all have in common , whether we within the prison sit or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and an example of that , where the differences are , is the following question .
i 'm in a call social focal up , i had a family member of what , once in custody .
there are usually very many of our participants in front of the line , and just very few of an .
a question , i 'd like in the us all connects the <unk> ' i 'd like them .
to please , i do you that they all even get up .
maybe we can be a little light , in the audience .
i can you see .
it are all .
well .
thank you .
i <unk> , you now a question , and if you this question , yes to answer to you back to myself , otherwise would remain they just stand .
that 's sort of our our line , we now to .
i have in my life of things done , for the i would be punished can be it was , but not .
if you this question , yes to answer to you please .
to count , drunk the risks .
to count , maybe , too low doses of <unk> obsessed .
to count , it with the seat , not very , taken .
okay .
and it 's also to be any workforce , not always very accurate signed up to have .
all right .
the most sit down .
we have a few angel in space .
that 's wonderful , i 'm happy .
thank you , you can , all back down .
at this question , if we the the events to ask , get our an very often to me .
and you will also , how much broader happiness , you may have had .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment , in the they were growing up , with the friends , but also very lucky , and that they may not always , caught been are if you something the edge of <unk> or also about it out to have done .
what are the results of our work ?
<unk> percent of our alumni , from within <unk> days after their <unk> a work .
this is rapidly as fast .
<unk> percent have , already on .
a third of the donor one in the last year we were <unk> .
and our <unk> is at seven percent .
i had it already told the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany , <unk> percent to .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> per year , taxpayers <unk> euros .
and it 's a <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> of seven percent to a <unk> of usually <unk> percent for a <unk> means .
when my father and i put together in the <unk> started to have , we 're open , stood up from pretty much for quite nuts , that .
i was my great <unk> in a big companies up .
but i have to tell you , i in my life , not so a <unk> work done .
we encourage our participants to take responsibility to take .
responsibility , in your life 's happened and , all of responsibility to take , in their lives will happen .
, not to hide , nothing to <unk> .
because that leads to a very new confidence and that 's also the to go back to trust building .
and so it makes me , especially happy and pride , when our participants , frankly , of their way to report .
here i put them a little video with .
film .
so i was convicted to two years , and eight months , because of dangerous <unk> .
i was because <unk> against the <unk> to three years , and 10 months , convicted .
i 've done with <unk> acted .
so , i judgment of two years , because of dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> , actually my complete life changed .
and what for me it was , was this <unk> , also done is .
because there was my , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , <unk> ' i almost to say , yeah .
i 've got back the goals , eyes <unk> .
i 've got back into perspective , i 've got back after the front of watched .
and you go with a very other minds and confidence from the custody out .
so far was a 's more and <unk> without a fixed these goals and then is you <unk> and in anything <unk> .
with the wrong people together and that now , not more .
well , the problem is that many no <unk> have the out .
that the problem , because then it 's automatically which , you go back in the old <unk> coming .
you know , nothing else .
by this <unk> individual <unk> , whatever , there 's all are going , at me just my whole mindset , i consider myself , about other , about the -- with problems , about the -- with the society , that , at me just as these two weeks , completely around .
i 've been <unk> of my first woman : divorce .
and since <unk> six months <unk> ' i went back with her .
that means , we have a new relationship started .
and because i under one , through this whole <unk> and many other things change i .
so much i ' i 've been achieved .
i 'm with my family back in pure the education started .
so i work today in my <unk> , <unk> ' i say .
i do , just a <unk> , <unk> .
you have to that really recognize that 's very , many people are the fact , like the example of my mentor , now , about this time , out and actually about to be yes , i do n't know , <unk> is beyond the people to support .
i 'm grateful for you to the idea at all come are , so what do .
i 'm grateful for you to it , despite with safety of trouble <unk> have and i 'm extremely grateful , of them to me .
that are one of course , the people , the support , and were .
i like i said , many people at the events talked , and the me again and confirmed that have that 's good , that do .
and it 'll ' i 's also do .
and to say , i thank you .
they come with us into prison .
each of them has something that we need .
if you our participants in their <unk> , which , if you as the <unk> to us to see if you in the frame of financial support and i am .
if you our program in a new <unk> to want , <unk> issue .
talk to us , please .
martin <unk> and i are here today .
and forward to us on the conversation with them .
thank you .
<unk> i , <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal <unk> .
in a time , i do something that way .
there is that makes you yes , these things .
, for <unk> for .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in a convent .
there 's yes , today , many ways as you with <unk> deal .
or how you <unk> deal .
anyway , i was <unk> also the way .
with my work and so 'n bit with the <unk> .
which i 'm here , of <unk> talk to .
and not from the real problems .
my problem was i was <unk> and i could get me , right <unk> like my life in 10 two decades , 30 years to look like going .
it was <unk> .
and this <unk> i thought was very scary .
now , it at least , to express .
in basically i had a <unk> <unk> crisis .
for as private .
i knew just not to the <unk> way to go ?
do what 's me just comfortable doing ?
or what if i mean <unk> again , new to throw it ?
and look , then what happens .
what then on me wait .
that were so the idea .
i was in this time , free <unk> at a day .
as i said <unk> .
the <unk> was for me , despite <unk> the absolute <unk> .
you <unk> free the world lives in very good hotels and <unk> the country on a very <unk> kind of the way .
<unk> but occasionally , very <unk> countries .
the developing world where it 's safe , more to see , and say , there than about <unk> villages , kind <unk> local people the , though they do n't have , so lucky , and joy <unk> .
right of these images and from cliché and live , but a <unk> way , too .
and exactly that was for me after a while the key .
i was that what i did to little .
to the surface .
and i found it 's a little <unk> of me about a country to write to judge that i actually do n't really know .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to countries are really know .
to <unk> article write to .
and to my personal interest to be breastfeeding .
how to learn to you countries are better know ?
by showing you with the people who lives .
the people who lives , at them home .
not in the hotel .
by showing you , with the challenges and with the problems of people .
and by showing you with the people who works .
at least was that the answer , i told me on this question to give you could .
and that i wanted to do .
and i wanted something meaningful .
i wanted a contribution to afford .
something good .
and this sense , at me , especially at a <unk> still further of .
i was , before , often in developing world , nepal , i just a particularly touched .
until <unk> was there 's a <unk> civil war , not just over and orphans , but also lots economic and social problems left .
with a year per capita income of <unk> dollars is nepal , the poorest country in asia .
and it 's going to continue to a the two poorest countries in the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
almost a fifth of the population of suffering , malnutrition .
forty percent of the adult can do n't read and write .
all these are connected with very many personal stories and <unk> , i on this journey had met me in a time , i was willing and frankly , was for change .
in the time i even something to change wanted .
and drum was after my return of nepal , my decision .
i quit my job .
and <unk> me at the aid .
and i <unk> ' now , just a excerpt from the answer <unk> the i on my job application received .
because they just a <unk> .
it 's here to a serious application , <unk> international by businesses .
and not to a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> the <unk> degree of time in nepal , i want , and a funding of your <unk> for .
hi ?
's still ?
my job application was really seriously , talking and good .
at least i thought that .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really down .
and i ' , right , right , emotional response is written .
and , never <unk> .
instead , i ' i do this , right to intense sense of taken to what good <unk> to do .
i 've got it 's used as an engine , to my own company to the reasons .
<unk> .
heart <unk> and soul <unk> .
a company that in basically exactly that offers , what i was looking for .
which is the way , a country , to traveling .
the way , a country right to meet .
by i do with the people , and a life and work .
and it 's not anywhere to work can , but in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you can actually in two words , apart .
so karma , and <unk> .
that means much the place , the you good karma collect .
so , the you good can do .
this sounds now 'n little bit <unk> .
it 's but not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use the tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
or we use <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and unsustainable tourism .
because the people , with us to do while your <unk> useful volunteering .
they pay for their journey , at a other organizers .
but they travel too simple way .
they live in <unk> .
and the objective is not as a lot of recreation , or as much <unk> but the real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and <unk> .
to get involved , our participants , ever , qualification , and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work , <unk> tourism , in areas and the otherwise , no chance on the classic tourism have .
because just the necessary in infrastructure to it 's missing .
the other , we can sustainable projects to .
we can own sustainable projects <unk> and finance .
we pay for us so to a hundred percent of itself .
are also not on giving <unk> .
and that 's us just for our long-term <unk> engagement of meaning .
started , we have with our work <unk> in nepal .
<unk> year we our engagement , on uganda <unk> .
and now after about four years , , we now i 've got married , and my husband and i are also for a team is a <unk> question .
we go about the <unk> way on ?
or what if we still a greater thinking ?
if we the <unk> still further to ?
if we do with the development is not just a social engagement and sustainable to my but the development in its wholeness that ?
and so , the individual <unk> have ?
or , <unk> individual <unk> .
that would then in basically a new an extra company .
a company , that , , company itself .
with other <unk> but the same philosophy , like <unk> .
we want that ?
i was the next question .
'n new business ?
sure we want that .
we love entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we in <unk> .
because we the same language .
because we the same dreams dream .
because we the challenges to understand .
and so we have in this year <unk> a sister , given .
<unk> .
and with <unk> and we 're creative companies in development and <unk> <unk> the we go through in the people to support .
to do with we the participants , entrepreneur , or the staff of creative companies with individual development <unk> .
so <unk> the personal social and <unk> other the <unk> include .
and <unk> the the <unk> prepare .
the there 's at <unk> , again .
a of the next to a meaningful <unk> still a more huge advantage .
he shows a in relatively short time on where you is , or where you <unk> .
where you may still <unk> stereotypes .
where you may be able to a flexible , is , to <unk> in thinking .
and he shows a on , what you really good .
this leads to a its strength , eyes .
that 's the creativity , suddenly , great .
or something that 's the serenity , you create new , in , discovered .
the serenity and things to the you ca n't you can change .
and the power , things to change , you can change .
and you very much change .
already in very short time .
we know that .
an example .
that are <unk> rose <unk> , lydia and <unk> .
that are five very wonderful women from uganda .
with a sad <unk> and with a talent .
they <unk> beautiful , <unk> <unk> for years .
and for years happened .
because they simply no market for it had .
because they did n't know , the quality of improving .
because you , nobody has said , which design may be in the question .
we wanted to these women help .
and have so in this year , a <unk> started .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
products of the people out of poverty out .
the you a income there .
a future to .
we 're yesterday with our <unk> live gone .
and we start with a first <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> of thousands of <unk> of our women .
the sale to them not just for a year , income .
but allows us also , the project , much bigger .
this first <unk> 's sort of social crowd <unk> and <unk> in a .
so who help to , can this , with the purchase a chain of doing the other , he said , but with us , directly into the project to travel .
he can be able to the women who travel and , active <unk> .
the long we want to do n't just five women 's a work to give them , but its or a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but also in nepal and in other <unk> , in which we <unk> work .
and this is , but this <unk> just a project from our integrated the cycle , the projects .
we 're working in all the central areas .
in <unk> <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work in just a in just to bit .
what happens with the kids when the women who work ?
right .
so we have in this year in nepal and in uganda , two <unk> centre , who started .
everything , and in our own cycle of each other .
and the power , more sense , as every project for .
in place where we 've ever , qualification into the various projects .
the <unk> ways to have , then , just in the common work .
and the end , i want you now , right on a journey to take them .
and to please , i do you the eyes to close .
<unk> , you , you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting , a wooden dining room .
and you 're happy and tired .
you just with your <unk> to lunch eaten .

the walls are <unk> .
in here is it 's warm .
you <unk> of the window .
and see kids on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet <unk> the sand on .

but soon , you going to get up .
and the <unk> , the that , the kids were , <unk> .
the end of the street is a tree .

mom <unk> washing in the courtyard , the pots .
they sing an african song .
you are relaxed , and happy .
you the eyes , again on .
each of us can the <unk> to meet , on something new <unk> .
or at least for a short time the dice me again to throw away .
and to look what happens .
thank you .
before i start , would give me interested , whether of you today at night , they 're here , already time someone 'n ' house occupied .
i just , with the light , not that really well , but perhaps want , someone came up .
down here just ' i find someone .
two .
here , up just ' i , not , but , down here are already , two , that 's beautiful , we 're already time to <unk> .
i , which is also a building occupied and it 's the villa mountain in east , the city <unk> .
this is the building .
together with two other people i ' i the villa out in the last summer , six months for occupied building .
and so <unk> ' i today at night , here , you .
well , and , like now some of you might say .
what is a 's also ?
<unk> there 's and yes , a lot .
but i want it just explain .
oh , what , you are occupied by now the villa out ?
and her <unk> then the park or how ?
just a small choosing the questions , we know , friends , colleagues have asked when you know , have , part of initiative , i <unk> ' to , something <unk> name , <unk> 'm .
all expected that we transition in the series of <unk> <unk> had .
and here about to this villa <unk> up , had , <unk> <unk> and the banner put up .
and to pick up against the privatization of villa out to protesting .
but who i know , i know that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was also not the elected <unk> the initiative .
what we see here , is a sign of the <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space , just private which is , and so for many people do n't available to is , <unk> ' i do n't say , but just not in public hand is , and why not so be used can , as you public spaces may use .
we were a group of <unk> together in the desire , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , sensitive and sustainable to deal .
and we wanted a different <unk> tell .
we were a <unk> team and that i must now , very quickly see , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , planning social -- , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , music , photography <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
now , the same time , with different social and cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspectives <unk> and <unk> .
and have to us to , on different skills , but also on different kinds of <unk> .
and creative part unconventional solutions in the <unk> , then we did have , <unk> to realize .
we 've actually navigated to the villa out to occupy .
but it was a 's us about that we the villa with stories and ideas to occupy .
we have to the memories and images being asked .
and from these memories and images out , trying to sort of perspectives , villa out to develop .
and it was we were really important that the process and more constructive remains .
us as an initiative , we have , always as <unk> platform and as <unk> terms .
so i was <unk> a <unk> and emotional thing , and i was , and after to a <unk> .
the experiences , we and you 've done , <unk> ' i now this evening into .
every city has <unk> places .
the one neighborhood , a face to give them .
in many cases , this , however <unk> and <unk> and be in the result of citizens , strangers are places are perceived value .
they are the dead people to a city because they just a lot not the correspond to what we 're in a public space expect .
so for instance , that we <unk> have , <unk> .
to this , but also the fact , public , the urban places we neglected , this will often <unk> .
initiatives , these places back to want to stay often , <unk> interest , in the infancy , put them .
what it has also with me to do , like here some questions , like some outside of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places to give our city not just a face .
no .
they are the social places of the city , in the our social life is happening .
so each other , there are often the first <unk> <unk> to our neighbors , if we need to the way , shopping to meet .
and we can this increase , if we just a <unk> opportunity to have to sit , and we actually stop the spaces , <unk> that are .
and we just 'n longer 'll have .
it to come to form , sometimes .
what but with safety of it 's a sense of community .
ever more who i and in that 's a public space , i ' <unk> faster and <unk> more of that , this community .
and when i do n't <unk> , is just that , what you probably the anonymity a big city called .
we were then , two challenges .
we can look at the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood up or in <unk> also <unk> be .
how can protest in the creation be transformed ?
how can only criticism in the ideas to be transformed ?
a protest against the privatization , and <unk> this <unk> <unk> places and criticism against the growing and actually also not <unk> <unk> that the same places .
imagine if you now , they sit here , even years ago , they beat the newspaper , and read the following the text .
i love <unk> and citizens , we invite you , we want you three things varieties , <unk> the <unk> imagine the a before carefully <unk> <unk> designed .
they allowed to the following , the idea of a variation pick .
and the variation , with the most <unk> will then <unk> implemented .
they would go ?
would anyone of them to this event , go ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds , first time .
there 's <unk> way , what <unk> .
they allowed to <unk> , like that in the future that looks .
and , like you first time it in the first moment .
i trial , me anyway , one explanation .
and it , because i the opinion , i 'm you ca n't really to join or pick up or <unk> , <unk> .
one , because the classic <unk> often , too late <unk> .
that means , mostly they have n't have an opportunity , really , your suggestions to make or the basic alternatives to discuss , but there 's actually , <unk> design and they allowed to <unk> , decide , if you <unk> or <unk> in the urban green plants .
or , as a friend who recently , what color the trash have the example .
second one explanation , classical <unk> 's rarely spoke about information and vote out .
you think , the three <unk> varieties .
we have here is what that we want to show you and you can then we vote .
frustration and incomprehension -- are often the consequences of what i also kind of which i find .
i anyway , to no choice about <unk> or <unk> make when i really rather <unk> <unk> way of <unk> <unk> had had .
it 's but also different .
although we the <unk> the existing <unk> of conversations that cost , we ultimately , much <unk> experience .
that we experience , took and the i want to now for other <unk> share .
i want it to pass , others have initiatives , other projects , but also , or , all , the city and , the policy .
because that those of the are , like <unk> actually do we should and the really responsible for those processes are .
if you find is really the interest , of participation of the way that 's so often <unk> and <unk> will then we need and then we need the them new <unk> .
ca n't last <unk> ' i but also , they all , you today , sit here .
and it 's why , because i <unk> for very important to think .
i <unk> , it for important , they all go , and i want you with our sample of encouraging the <unk> still a chance to be .
and i then i me , they all , because you who are , the them a new <unk> <unk> .
so we have to participation look like to the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood and feel like , involvement and <unk> to <unk> ?
one willingness for the conversation on playing field .
in <unk> meet the professionals , <unk> , citizens on <unk> and different parts of interest , each other .
what we see here , is a picnic , to the we invited to have .
what we see here , are some <unk> and <unk> in the conversation with citizens .
the goal to be , all these conversations on playing field of , so , not the <unk> interest , or the <unk> skills about the skills of citizens .
the citizens , place are experts , they 're experts , for their neighborhood , you know , what you missing , which <unk> you with a place to connect , in which tradition of a place is , and also , what you , a place , lacking .
the <unk> , ago all the city can put , on <unk> level in the project into to .
in <unk> or in in a particular case , then another <unk> be involved in the issues <unk> , just on the project <unk> are , ever after .
all this leads to a <unk> , in the all of information for all available are and the then the place to can be .
by maybe , traces , can be , a positive identification of the place to .
a conversation on playing field is also the wishes of residents in fact taken seriously .
and it also then , if somebody says , i want a <unk> next to the marketplace .
that can course , in rubbish be , but the goal to be , in <unk> dialog with all that <unk> , what is right solution , and maybe in <unk> then also the <unk> accommodate , but perhaps , a another place .
, that has to get out of the conversation turned out , then .
second point are ways <unk> .
our <unk> 's colorful .
one feels , totally , i think , when he ago <unk> large group is , and talk .
a others can it 's good writing to but the text , then not going on <unk> large group .
a 's what might be or photographing it .
or building his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i 'm going to say it has to different <unk> give to different market to .
we have here for the way , just to come , to be , first time you watch her , what happens .
in the background <unk> small exhibition .
we have here is the opportunity had , <unk> to be .
we have the opportunity had to paint .
we have the opportunity had to write .
regardless of the age .
that was a <unk> girl .
we had the way , our ideas with their faces to connect to play with ideas to <unk> .
also the way , outside of <unk> <unk> , to participate , should always been given to be .
that can for about a <unk> happen , that can think about <unk> <unk> happen .
the <unk> and transparent having the results of the dialogue , under the are .
we even have the entire process in parallel on facebook with and on a lot of independent blog , and the news <unk> about a <unk> distributed .
our third point <unk> .
you remember , maybe that i said that <unk> often to be late take place .
in my <unk> event there 's already have three finished <unk> .
<unk> is the process , but only then when he 's very early takes place and the them in ideally , even still do n't know , with <unk> area happen to .
if through the dialogue , and so i went back the point , one got to be discussed this is the scenarios for an area in the question is coming .
<unk> heard the way , also , <unk> itself .
and , then , if not from beginning , that is that the <unk> event , and so look , but the experiences from the previous rebuild .
what happens now , if , citizens of your city from and your city <unk> .
it 's already in numerous projects .
i , here 's an example of <unk> , is the <unk> , is probably , you here 's known .
in new york was just a project launched , there 's going to a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> 're there within one of six weeks <unk> dollars , got into the funding to make should or at least <unk> .
the time has to in august i wrote the politics , i could n't quite different , as the idea to their own .
also the <unk> in new york , to the i think , i 'm not even more to say to , because he has to a the <unk> the city 's become was no idea of politics or educational administration .
in the opposite , the <unk> for the <unk> were already .
in <unk> , so we 're back in germany , have the citizens , so plans to <unk> one by , again <unk> .
the city was told <unk> 's not necessary .
the four weeks <unk> , we for <unk> <unk> have the rich are completely different than <unk> .
today is the <unk> the city , offline .
during the side <unk> d e , wonderful work and the city of the <unk> the initiative , the , there 's founded , and other <unk> supported .
elsewhere paint the citizens share their own <unk> the road .
in rotterdam was a <unk> <unk> .
everything well , and so far , you want now say .
then we do but now just so on .
but i think it for the wrong , the city of the responsibility to .
why ?
, , because they yes , a look for a 's all have or should have .
during the dedicated to be it citizens of initiatives , or businesses , in the rule on a for you in some form of the relevant part of focus has the city against the responsibility for the projects , also the edge of attention .
and the other of course , if the city of the projects taking , are other means to .
a <unk> initiative , this just <unk> of .
also our goal was the way , an initiative , after their major planned that was about half a year of the results and the responsibility , the city to wanted .
current was a <unk> has the villa out in january you bought .
it run , there .
so we have , the moment that problem that we the responsibility , not a could .
but we know , now , that the city of the villa successful <unk> the negotiations , actually succeed , are , then a <unk> be going .
in which sort of the place is , however , frankly .
to finally , to come and i 'm sort of that convinced that many projects , because of their meaning , complexity or , of the cost of the city has evolved to be a chance to have any satisfaction to being and positive identification , to create .
if you just in time and in dialogue with the citizens <unk> be .
in each of the city and citizens .
in each of the city and you all , you today at night , sit here .
if we put for and at the policymakers in the <unk> the citizens did n't even more than to stop perceive , but rather than <unk> .
this is it .
last night , the <unk> we were here in <unk> in <unk> and are so the <unk> come .
we have about <unk> talked about .
so this idea , <unk> second chance to have , if it in this life , not <unk> , then just are still time <unk> second chance .
we found very exciting .
and we were , but relatively fast we agree that 's two things that there , we do n't still time you 're trying to .
that a is the puberty .
the second life there was also immediately unit of the table , time in the school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you remember , may still <unk> out <unk> .
at me , it is yes , are now that <unk> years ago , but the words , lead , i immediately to <unk> hands .
my neck <unk> , together and i just want to come back on it <unk> .
and then i do n't , how it at them was , but in my exams , was then , of the that with the <unk> taken seriously , the was always the next to me .
no idea , from the actually become .
they 're going to understand it , so , my school was n't really beautiful and after i then my last <unk> behind me had was completely clear , never again , school .
and what should i now say , when i on the year <unk> back of the most days , i there 'd spent i ' , i ' i in schools have spent .
with a desire and totally be .
how she came , that ?
how could this happen ?
that started first time , so , that something happens is , what i do n't do you could .
i got kids .
so , my wife 's got the children .
and that was then also very clear , one is the , this <unk> to do had .
to the a day , when they said , honey , it 's <unk> .
and today are you .
yes , <unk> .
there has opened , the door and then i was sitting there of in this <unk> , whoa , i felt <unk> in the <unk> .
that looked right , the way that 's time , we looked .
and that made , still so how much like school at it made , and i <unk> ' me , human being here , yes , <unk> changed .
and when i then the teacher , say , i heard and you know , the kids learn not for the school , but for a 's live there <unk> ' i told me , oh my god , the sentence , i ' i yes , and then , not <unk> .
what is that , what we 're from the school , from this high school , for a 's life really took have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really good learned .
where they 've actually in your life <unk> , time i really well we can ?
and maybe you know some , the capital from yugoslavia means .
what 's still time in yugoslavia ?
or <unk> , this ability in short time as much know , in , <unk> , just , so i do it then on a button again <unk> can , to me a bad will be ?
well , i ' that time needed for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what she says , <unk> of one point , one of it turns out whether someone , a good doctor 's going ?
if the empathic , is , and if the good diagnostic of has ?
no way .
so , no way , for a 's life , not for the school , we learn .
if we so back , about <unk> years , the middle of <unk> century , like that yes , you voted .
this is the time , in the time in germany , the <unk> then eventually , fully introduced .
and where we also the system , how we do it today , its roots .
and when we the time and then imagine , it was actually so , the people at the had no access to know their time .
and there were these four or six years , they sort of forced to have been , in the school to go and with knowledge of been that were then we really the only way , the had to with the know , and the facts and the information in their time in contact to come .
today has a <unk> more information in his pocket , as the library of the most of time .
and the middle of <unk> century , that was the time the industrialization .
that means , there , some changes in the world and there were suddenly people needs , these new machines service , were .
the same time , but also people needs , these machines , wait , and fix it could .
and we need people , these machines to build could and the these factories were .
may recognize , it already .
that <unk> system , that we now in germany , you ask you still have , has its root in this time .
and has been there might make sense .
also , because it was probably really like this was that , what i in the school , that i ' for the work at the assembly line , well , who the assembly line was , stood there be for life .
we do <unk> at the future .
let we that <unk> century , where it is , and we 're going to look at the year <unk> .
this year <unk> was the year , there was the first <unk> just briefly about to pop .
i was with my studying those ready and i thought , now is the time , now do you on the first company .
yes , after some to me around , with the internet , <unk> ' i , <unk> ' i think that 's also now time .
and some of businesses are , we <unk> and they were bigger and always gets bigger , and we 're so beautiful slow grown , and some of the companies are then , us again , in case <unk> .
you see , two times in life .
and we then after a few years , 30 staff .
so , we had so a growth and we had so exciting professions , on how <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know , if you <unk> concrete idea that have , what these people do , but when i in the went to school , we had no idea that 's so what ever give you would .
even when i <unk> did was , so what 's like the internet is still not talking about .
and the children , we now in the school to what the job to the in 10 to fifteen to 20 or 30 years have ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and , which you know , which are going to the need to in this future jobs to succeed , to be ?
and if you 'll be honest , are , also , the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we have degrees , in the future looking who could tell me , because the <unk> for the saturday , there .
there 's <unk> <unk> , i ' i read .
well , you see , they have no idea .
how to get then we get out what to school for a 's lives learning it ?
what are the things , we need to kids for a 's life would fit to do ?
and maybe help so a view , in this , what companies today , collaborators to look .
that that are yes , the <unk> of school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and the universities are coming then in the company .
and if you , so <unk> classic <unk> at , then there is , the first place in , so what the expertise .
there to the , so the reading , then , we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and of 12 years in offshore .
this is going to school right now , and also in the future can not afford .

and the you can look in principle in three major groups to summarize .
this is , the company wish , collaborators , flexible they are , flexibility in this is a .
and then i wish , almost all companies in the staff with <unk> think .
and then i wish , these companies on the <unk> .
so we flexibility leaders , thinking and <unk> .
we start with the flexibility .
this is relatively quickly to understand .
if we look at the economy is now works , how fast , yes , how fast , everything that changes .
<unk> , the whole business models are the internet of today on the morning on the head asked .
there to practice , i employees , with this change to deal .
there to practice , i employees , the creative .
there to practice , i employees , the <unk> .
this is pretty exactly the opposite of the what in the factory in the <unk> century of collaborators at the assembly line it had .
also the second subject of the entrepreneurial think is relatively clear .
there 's the responsibility .
there 's going to people , take responsibility .
first time for , and their own life .
but also for the big whole .
if this now the company is , or , as a wish we people , take responsibility for the big whole .
and the third factor , the <unk> , is almost the most <unk> .
and when we , the soccer cup , remember , then there 's and there on the these beautiful saying .
argentina , <unk> <unk> portugal , <unk> and germany has a team .
it was n't <unk> <unk> the world cup , won .
that were able to the only a common to create .
and , somebody , this big innovator our time , steve jobs , yes , <unk> .
it was not the , the iphone invented has , has not the <unk> invented , has about itunes n't invented , has nothing of them .
the had a team , that this possible has done , because just as a team who were the that do what they did .
so <unk> school , these three things that could , that 's about , <unk> school , in the we for a 's lives learning .
but there 's still <unk> fourth point , and the is me almost more important .
and that 's learning to yourself .
if the only , what we about the future with safety saying , is that they uncertainty is then is , but the ability , and new to learn and fun and to have this learning to see the <unk> that we in the future life , and that our children in the future life would succeed .
that 's about , but <unk> school , these things that .
but where i was ?
i was sitting in this <unk> and the of them , the kids have the know that 's not just <unk> event is , for the you <unk> pay to .
so <unk> event , and after the slogan , all said , not from any .
to the time , where <unk> who are , there are then suddenly all of invisible .
yes , i sat there and what should i say , the <unk> one of my kids were these <unk> , the funniest parts of the event .
less fun , it was for me as a father , if so the stress about the subject of homework and learn the entire family life <unk> .
and still less fun makes it , if the child was sick , is , because in the school , stress there .
and finally ended up these <unk> or was a peak of <unk> , this school , again , 'n <unk> .
just took it was also not <unk> , it was more like a <unk> , so right after the hour and in fact , we were also the single parents , invited .
and i <unk> , you now , and also told me the details , by and after the point was , we need to our child , your issue that 's not .
<unk> are , but two years , in which we did have , does anything .
what do we really wrong ?
and we had to us actually the question i asked that 's our child is broken ?
and we are the only , where it that 's okay ?
now i ' i in the last two years , since i in the subject 'm involved with very many people talked and i ' that , no way i ' learned , you 're not alone .
there are very many , where it very similar to go and this was two years ago , i was sitting with <unk> <unk> together we were just and , a company to the reasons , have the day we thought , where the journey , there goes , and at sitting we , the bar and have to us about the private things <unk> .
and what should i say , he has to me almost the same story with a his children , he almost the same experienced as we , and we had the lucky that we our children there to take could from the school , yeah ?
in berlin , there 's one <unk> <unk> , different schools and we could even a charter schools in consider to .
but can that everyone out there are doing ?
somehow was telling us that to bit , just our children in safety to and this it out there are so be able to let me , how they are .
and after we 're both right now the impression that had to school , since we were there 's not so really changed , we thought , well , we are the first , this issue right now time to do .
just , how shall we as <unk> there anything to change ?
the good is that we deceived .
we 're not alone .
but we have a relatively quickly <unk> whole series of amazing people found , what a similar to how we , which <unk> school to create , all are an will .
it is yes , not so , just the children and their parents , under the suffering , out there are often happens .
if we the teachers to look , 30 percent of teachers have <unk> .
if we look , like , the number <unk> in the last 10 years has changed the , doubled .
it can now be , all parents , what 's wrong to do ?
that all children down are and that , this lady teacher is broken are ?
or it can be that we have a system have , that just not more than that fit , this <unk> ago <unk> years , fits quite simple , not more , right .
and we have many people found , where it , went and we even people found , not have kids .
and they 've got you to take responsibility to for the future that you take responsibility to for the future , by showing you take responsibility for that , what we our children and the kids , now in the go to school , with the way to be .
and we , <unk> second the <unk> there 's out there <unk> whole series of great initiatives , the school to change you want , and there 's there 's <unk> schools , here and there really great <unk> and there 's almost , every school teacher , really involved are and something to change .
and there 's even the , or other brave principal , the , then also <unk> the first step to go .
and how we now as <unk> help ?
we had yes , no concept that we there are now about helping us could .
but we can be a thing to do , we can in these schools , and we can , those schools in the people , the school is , so the parents , the teachers and the students , together and we can with which in two days <unk> whole bunch of moving .
there are coming so people together , in the past more so each other 've been working and the learning in two days , what it together to work .
the come with <unk> , concrete challenge , you in common problems .
and after two , days have the then for a new <unk> developed sooner or the <unk> given for <unk> completely new high as we , of the berlin to school , with to .
or the have a concrete things for <unk> problems , you in your school have , evolved .
within one of two days in developed approaches , the next day and immediately , which can be .
but what that <unk> is , what , these two days happens , and that makes it for me , so beautiful , a couple weekends , i ' , then also time , schools in , germany to spend , is this energy , there is when the three things to learn .
if the three things together to experience , which is so what the flexibility <unk> .
so of leaders , thinking and if you , team to experience .
then is that a of the <unk> .
and if we are four weeks after that <unk> workshop , so <unk> school to come back then you know , we realized that , the school as a whole started , to change , there <unk> completely new islamic culture that 's .
and this is incredibly <unk> .
and i <unk> ' they time i invite new thing about the school to think .
i <unk> ' they time i invite , about the school , thinking .
and i <unk> , you , all , also to invite , about , about the school , to talk .
talk you about this , what you like , but to talk , they also that , what you do n't like .
they would be surprised , how much <unk> you get , and how many people that same have , but just not about it 's talk .
you make us , you make us every school in germany , into <unk> century , to .
you make us the entire system .
and you make us the common to do with the people the school day for a day off , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because only in common , we can that create .
thank you .
