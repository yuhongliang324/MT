when steve lopez , funny , we go to los angeles times , one day through the streets in the center of go to los angeles , i went , i heard he 's a wonderful music .
they came from a man , a african-american , <unk> , very rough , homeless , on a violin and playing the only still two strings , had .
a lot of you 're going to the story , know , because of <unk> article about it was later a book , that again <unk> was , robert <unk> junior , when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> school , and of very promising career tragically early by his <unk> schizophrenia , ended .
nathaniel left <unk> , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , living , he as homeless in the streets of <unk> row in the center of go to los angeles .
i recommend you all , <unk> book to read or , the film at , so they can not just the wonderful connected to understand , between these two men that is , but also the music , to make it and how they finally , the instrument was , if this pun allows is that <unk> , nathaniel away from the road to get .
i met this mr <unk> in the years since 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a demo of <unk> first , and fourth symphony of and came from behind the stage , to , i imagine .
he talked in a very <unk> and <unk> sound over the yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and about the dodgers , it never in the baseball world series of creating would . and that all of the <unk> passage that the violin at the last sentence of <unk> fourth symphony .
we came to talk about music to talk . and a few days later , i got an email , in the was that nathaniel , for <unk> , i was interesting .
i must , say , nathaniel a medical treatment <unk> , because he was already with <unk> and with <unk> and <unk> treated been , a trauma , that it be whole life being .
as a result of that he is now , particularly prone to for these <unk> stages . the 're sometimes , so bad , and he days away , in the streets of <unk> row <unk> , and that the horror and the <unk> his own mind to .
and in exactly like a <unk> found myself , nathaniel , when we do with our first class , walt disney <unk> hall , started . he had this 'm flickering in his eyes and it seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible demons and smoke and about how to him , somebody in your sleep , poison and i wanted .
i 'm scared , not <unk> , but i 'm scared , i saw him lose it could that he 's in a lot of conditions into , and that i told him its relationship to the violin destroying it could , when i started , about <unk> and <unk> and others and exciting forms of <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started doing so simple , to play .
i played the first set of <unk> <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed on , in <unk> eyes a <unk> change ago , went .
it was , as if he was under the impact of invisible have was , a chemical response , of the catalyst for my game .
<unk> <unk> anger into , in understanding , in a steady curiosity and <unk> .
and how through a miracle that he took his violin and started , to be heard some clips from <unk> to play and asked me then , you to end to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started , then , about music to talk , i started from the stream , beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , of <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i was clear that he 's not just a <unk> know about music owned , but it with her , a tight personal relationship connected .
he spoke of her with a passion and a greater understanding that i else only one of my colleagues in the philharmonic , we go to los angeles know .
by he 's music playing and about music , talking , was out of this <unk> , confused a man , that , by the streets of go to los angeles pulled it was , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> <unk> musician .
music is medicine . music , changes us .
for nathaniel means that music <unk> health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and delusions , help his imagination and creativity in something real <unk> .
and so <unk> he told his <unk> being .
i understood that 's exactly this is that nature of the art .
exactly this is the reason , why we music to do : so we do something that in all of us , deep in the inside is , our feelings , by our artistic lens , by our creativity to the fact , forms .
and the fact that expression , all of us , and moves , inspired , and it unites us .
what nathaniel <unk> , brought him the music back in a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music brought him back in a family of musicians , it mind , be a talent and i realized , and it <unk> .
and i 'm always comes back with nathaniel music , no matter whether , walt disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me that , why i musicians have become 'm .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you very much .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want something to play , that i <unk> the <unk> stolen .
i hope , they <unk> me .
so i have in my life , many fishes known .
i just two loved .
this first , that was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good it , <unk> , a best-selling book on the menu .
what for a fish .
still better , he was in <unk> after the the highest standards of sustainability seeing .
you could , so , and feel , it to sell .
i had with this beauty of a relationship , several months .
one day , called the head of the company , and said , if i at an event from could about the sustainability , the farm .
`` course , '' i said .
here was a company , to solve was trying to this incredible problem for our chefs 's become . how to keep we fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have the oceans , fish like we forests <unk> beaten .
it 's hard , the destruction began to <unk> .
90 percent of the big fish , the , we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they are totally collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so is , or an evil <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
a lot of arguments against it . <unk> pollute the environment , the most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that means , 15 pounds <unk> are required to you a pounds <unk> get .
not very sustainable .
it tastes , not very good .
so here was finally have a company , trying to it right .
i did they supported .
the day , the event , called i the head of <unk> for the company .
we call him , don .
`` don , '' i said , `` only to the facts , right to have , you are famous for , so far out in the sea grow , you the environment is not being polluted water . ''
`` this is true , '' he said , `` we 're so far out the waste of our fish and distributed going to do n't focused on . ''
and then we added , he 's add , `` we 're in basically a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one of what ? what an her ? ''
`` sustainable and proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said , put on .
and , that night was i in bed and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so called i the next day , briefly , the event , don .
i said , don , for instance , are sustainable and proteins right ? ''
he said , he goes into this is not . he 'll <unk> .
now , i <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could tell me a <unk> answer to be . until i finally , <unk> biologists <unk> .
we call it also , don .
`` don , '' i said , `` what the example are sustainable and proteins right ? ''
now , he mentioned , some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , feathers to the skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and to forage process . ''
i said , `` how much percent <unk> <unk> 's chicken ? `` well ,
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
`` well , that are about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , don , what 's sustainable that chicken , fish to feed ? ''
there 's a long to break in the line and he said , `` there 's just to a chicken , the world . ''
i <unk> me from this fish .
no , not , because i 'm a <unk> <unk> and <unk> 'm .
that i 'm actually .
no , i <unk> actually from this fish <unk> , because , i swear , god , the fish , this conversation , grilled chicken <unk> .
this second fish , that 's a different kind of <unk> .
it 's the romantic sort of the way , the you , ever better if you put his fish , learns , you the fish <unk> more love .
i told him first in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
a <unk> journalist who had been long time of this fish about .
she has us a way , <unk> .
he came on the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef who had him <unk> .
<unk> twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can a fish that well taste , let , after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't it , but this guy can it .
we call him miguel , actually means he miguel .
and no , he has the fish , cooked , and he 's not a chef . at least on the way , you and i do it to understand .
he 's a biologist , <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner <unk> .
you is near the <unk> the river <unk> .
until the 1980s , was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they <unk> <unk> the , in basically the wetlands , were .
they did that , by showing you the country <unk> .
they built this complicated result of the channels , and you who water from the land out and beyond the river .
now , they could n't make that was , economically .
and ecologically and it was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of birds to , for this place , many birds are .
and so , 1982 , a spanish company with green the country , bought .
what they 've done ?
they have the river of water around .
they have literally the on <unk> .
instead of the water <unk> used to the channels , the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a 11,000 of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , eel that -- and have miguel , and his company in the environmental destruction , completely around .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they have something that still never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , a million miles away is , and everything what you 're <unk> channels and this dense , lush march .
i was there , not long time with miguel .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part `` a crocodile , kissing . ''
okay ? there were , and she fought for us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , you have mud , to my travels at , and miguel holding in such calm down a <unk> .
here , picks up , he 's a rare <unk> .
now i mentioned , he the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , see here he 's a pattern of <unk> , that it , the <unk> giraffe , it .
it turns , that miguel the most of his career in <unk> national park in africa has spent .
i asked him , how he wants to be so a <unk> 's become .
he said , `` the fish ? i know anything about the fish .
i 'm an expert , relationships . ''
and then goes , he and over , in more <unk> of those rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and , do n't get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was really about this <unk> piece <unk> fish , that i the <unk> had .
so i 've got it <unk> . i said , `` miguel , how it comes to your fish that well taste ? ''
he showed up with the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , that 's unbelievable .
but what we eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , he <unk> on for me to tell that 's like a rich system is that the fishes better food , what you in the wilderness of food , you .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fish an .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there 's no food .
ever of a farm heard , their animals not an ?
later , the day and i on this site , miguel around and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , so , seems to be '' , different than any rural farm , the i ever been was , `` how it , you success ? ''
in the moment , it was , as if a <unk> a <unk> to have .
and we must bow to the corner and we provided , the most sight , thousands and thousands pinker flamingos , literally , pinker carpet , so far the eye enough .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look you , their bellies , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> they 're not your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose within 20 percent of our fish and <unk> , the birds .
now the last year were on this site 600,000 , birds , more than 250,000 , different ways .
it 's now the largest and one of the private <unk> in , europe .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last thing that you on a <unk> have to ? ''
he 's going to his head , no .
he said , `` we build <unk> , not hard .
this is a who network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
ever , pinker so the belly <unk> better , the system . ''
okay , you make us that come . a farm , their animals not an and a farm , their success , the health of her to measure .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way to this flamingos on the first place did n't even be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles away , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning to fly , they are 240 kilometers to farm .
and every night fly , they are 240 miles back .
they do that , because they the <unk> white line the highway <unk> follow .
seriously .
i had to me a kind of the journey of the penguins imagined , so at i miguel , .
i said , `` miguel , fly , they are 240 kilometers to the farm and fly , then keep 240 miles back at night ?
they do that for the children ? ''
he looked me , when i just a song of the whitney houston , quotes .
he said , `` no . they do that , because the food is better . ''
i 'm not the skin of my beloved fish mentioned , delicious was , and i do n't like <unk> . i like they do n't <unk> . i like they do n't <unk> .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i cooking , almost never with it .
and yet , when i do you in this restaurant in <unk> one have , they do n't want to <unk> <unk> .
they she 's sweet and in , as if you a half bites by the ocean , would .
i mentioned that to miguel , and he <unk> .
he said , `` the skin does like a swam .
you is the last <unk> , before , in the body into .
you , over the evolution of evolved to <unk> <unk> . ''
and then we added , he 's add , `` but our drinking water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm , your fish do n't an . a farm , their success is measuring the success of its predators .
and then i was , when he says , a farm , no <unk> , <unk> he shares powerful , because the water , that through this farm flows comes from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , all the things with , leads to sort of rivers , that are , you with , to lead , chemical pollutants , drain , <unk> .
and if it , by the system , fought , and this leaves there is the water cleaner , how it <unk> is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm , their animals not an , not just a farm , their success , the health of her to measure , but a farm , literally a <unk> is , and not just for these fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i guess it , and that they should also do , because these <unk> , like this also always , is also <unk> .
you could tell you to a recipe is for the future , good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what we now we need , is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food in fact , well , and taste .
but for many people that 's a little to radically .
we 're not <unk> , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we 're talking about regional food . we eat , organic .
and if they claim that the things are the future , good food assure that somebody somewhere on and says , `` hey , people , i love the pink flamingos , but how you going to the world to feed ?
how you going to the world to feed ? ''
can i be honest ?
i like this question is not .
no , not , because we 've been enough calories are producing the world more than just to feed .
a billion people are today <unk> .
a billion -- that 's more than ever before -- because <unk> inequalities that in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i like this question is not , because they the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years about what determines who has .
<unk> grain , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , chemicals , the earth , grilled chicken , fish , and all the time has the agribusiness , just wondered : `` if we are more people 's cheaper to feed , how awful can that already be ? ''
that was the <unk> . it was , which . it was the business plan the american agriculture .
we should they call , what you is , a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> , that quickly , who capital <unk> , that 's exactly this production to .
this is not <unk> , and it 's not invent agriculture .
our <unk> today is threatened , because <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through the fertile one country , not by the pumps , but through fresh water , not by the chainsaws , but by the forests , and not by <unk> and safety nets , but by the fish in the sea .
they want to the world to feed ?
you make us to start with the question : how we going to myself to feed ?
or better , how do we conditions do , every community to enable , , to feed ?
to try to do this , you look not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and ever-faster machines are at <unk> and it has never been something really good for food produced .
we 're going to look instead , the ecological model .
this is that , that on two billion years <unk> <unk> .
let me , you miguel , farmers how miguel ,
are , not worlds for , are , are the restore , rather <unk> , are the <unk> grow , rather than just hard to farmers , not just <unk> are , but experts , relationships ,
because they are ones , also become experts , flavor .
and when i really be honest , i 'm they 're a better chef : when i do it ever be going .
you know , that 's me , right , because if that the future , good food is , they are delicious .
thank you .
if i do you today a thing <unk> want it 's the of the data , we consume , greater is as the sum of bits and instead , , <unk> to think , i want you think about how we information that can use that , patterns have and we so these trends that , otherwise , not visible to become be .
so , what we see here 's a typical <unk> after some old way .
this program , that i 'm here to use , is a little experiment .
it means <unk> and what i do with <unk> can do is , after a certain death filter it can , we say , accidents .
and instantly i see a different patterns that , .
and it , because in <unk> here the people at <unk> are and they over here at <unk> .
we can take a step further out and like the data and then a new , and see that <unk> and cancer in the usual suspects , are , but not for every time .
if we now go and after the age <unk> , we say , 40 years or a younger , we see , accidents , even the cause is about the , the people care to be .
and who <unk> see that is particularly at the men is true .
you see so that look of information and data in this way , very , swim in a living <unk> it .
and if we do this for raw data can do why not , content in itself ?
what we now have here are the <unk> every single , `` <unk> <unk> '' , ever going to print .
it 's all here . it 's everything online .
you can it would like after my talk , in their rooms and test .
with <unk> can you to in a decade .
you can go into in a particular one year .
you can go directly to a copy one .
if i now here , i look , i see the athletes , in this small copy that appear and the <unk> .
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , so click , i go <unk> , me , spending to show in which lance armstrong mentioned will .
now , when i just a <unk> of get to , i could think , `` ok , what if i all with the subject of walking i look ? ''
so i a step back and <unk> the way .
now i greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of that if you on this kind of information on , <unk> , more , <unk> , <unk> , for you do n't or <unk> not just .
you do something that actually a little bit different .
it 's something between , and we think it 's changing the way , and the way as information can be used .
i want this idea now a little bit further out with about what a little nuts .
what here we 've done is , we have every single <unk> taken and you on a little summary down .
the summary of a quick <unk> and a symbol for the area of you come .
i 'm only time the top of the 500 of the popular <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we have a lot of things do .
immediately , we get a sense , the issues , on wikipedia , the popular .
i 'm now this issue <unk> '' vote .
now , after i <unk> , who have know , i the <unk> , the , the most likely to <unk> time <unk> `` people the year , '' .
this is really important , there is a realization that is , not in a single <unk> 's .
that 's just to see if you a step back and the entire at them .
<unk> on a certain that <unk> i can then in the subject of time <unk> `` people the year , '' in to go , and all together .
if i now all these people look know , i the majority of <unk> . some people come from the science . some , less , come from the economy . here is my head . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , is a bono 's also a ted prize winner .
so we can now to jump , and a look on all the ted prize winner and throw away .
you see , we 're surfing the web the first time as if it also really a net is , not only from side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want you what else to show what a little surprise to be .
i show you here 's just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i want it 's not a browser call it ; it 's really not a browser , but you can websites to look -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website , like this .
so i can take a step back , and directly to a specific <unk> jump .
this is so important , because you just through that look at the web in this kind of the way , the <unk> the same kind of the way of that can .
so i can in my course of zoom in a certain <unk> .
here is the was the demonstration , i 'm going to go in touch .
and i can sort everything , what i am today has been considered have , again <unk> .
and , when i went back a step <unk> and on everything i look , i can tell my course of new to organize and maybe , my <unk> . here , i have to <unk> ' for , here , bing , right here to live labs <unk> .
and from here i can in the side into and they 're back up .
it 's a metaphor , and it 's going , and every time it makes this picture than the sum of <unk> .
the moment , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we talk from the curse at the <unk> .
we talk from `` drowning in information . ''
what , if we do this situation around could and the internet on the head to ask , so that we instead , from a to the other to go to start of many things to many things go to , and the pattern of see , what otherwise 's remained be ?
if we do this can do , is this <unk> <unk> , maybe a new source of sense of information .
and , instead , just in information to move , we know it .
and if we know you know , then we might even the wisdom of it to .
so i hear on , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> <unk> science fiction .
in my school and i do with the bus to school , every day an hour a way .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> , that my thoughts in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> in my deep in me sitting , voracious curiosity <unk> .
this curiosity that , also , that i always , when i 'm not in the school was , by the forests <unk> , around and `` samples . '' and gathering , frogs and snakes and the beetle , and <unk> , everything to home to and under the microscope at .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it went and always the trial , the world to understand and the limits of <unk> .
and my love to science fiction to , in my environment <unk> , because the time , in the late '60s , flew , the moon and they were the deep ocean .
jacques cousteau came in our living with his amazing shows , we animals and places and a world of miracle that showed me , we did before i never have can imagine .
that has then , very good to the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's neither of video , these <unk> with computer-generated movies , the imagery in the media , there , i had to the images in my head , create .
that we had at all . if we as kids a book i read , and we the description of <unk> and projected that they 're on the screen in our minds .
my response that was the drawing , and draw from alien , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and all so what .
in class i was the time from teachers get caught , as i , <unk> textbook in the <unk> .
the creativity to <unk> somehow get out .
and i was something interesting . what makes me , which , jacques <unk> shows fascinated , was the idea , a us to be completely unknown world here on our earth itself .
certainly would i yes , never an alien world with a spaceship . that seemed to me pretty unlikely .
but here was a world , i actually enter could , here on the earth , and she was just amazing , and more exotic as all that , what i always imagined was , when i these books have read it had .
so i decided , when i was 15 , divers , to be .
the only problem , was , i was in a small village in canada , living , one , miles away from the ocean away .
of them and i do n't <unk> .
i <unk> my father , until he finally , <unk> in <unk> , new york , down did was , on the other the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in winter , in <unk> , new york .
the ocean , but , a real ocean , i received only two years later to face , when we need to california , moved .
since , in the 40 years , now <unk> are , i 've got about three , hours , under water spent . 500 million hours of them in <unk> .
and i 've learned that the world of the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich , <unk> life is , how we do it gives us really hardly anyone can imagine .
the imagination , the nature knows , no borders , in opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
to of days i feel i just utter awe , that , what i on my <unk> see .
and my love to the ocean is , with the same intensity as time and ever .
when i then as an adult a job <unk> , it was that <unk> .
that seemed to the best way , my inner drive the stories to tell , with my need to take pictures to create , to unite .
as a kid who drew i always <unk> and so .
so , movies , the way , images and stories <unk> . that fit together .
of course , the stories , i <unk> , from the <unk> , `` the terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> . ''
, `` <unk> '' i mean for the <unk> and that was diving , <unk> connect .
so intertwined , sort of my two passions .
something interesting happened , `` <unk> '' : to a <unk> problem in this film to solve -- and that we had so a kind of liquid <unk> create -- , <unk> we have the computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
what and came out , was the first computer-generated <unk> , ever in a film to see .
the film got it 's no money , right said , i was he just one time , by a , but i realized something fascinating , the audience around the world was like <unk> from the magic , of it was .
according to arthur clarke 's law , are you know <unk> technology and magic does n't even more of other to distinguish kin .
you saw so something magic .
and that i thought was incredibly exciting .
and i said , `` wow , that has to do in the <unk> be involved . ''
so we went in `` the terminator , two , '' my next movie , much further .
together with <unk> created , there , the guy from liquid metal . the success was hanging , of ab , like this effect come would .
and it worked . again , we had something magic . and the effect in the audience was the same . however , we have with the film , a bit more money <unk> .
of these experiences from , was a very new world , a very new world of creativity , <unk> .
so i was a company , together with my good friend <unk> winston , to the time the best <unk> and <unk> . they called `` the digital <unk> . ''
the idea of the company , it was the stage <unk> processes with visual <unk> etc . to skip ahead and the same with digital <unk> to start .
that we did then , and -- we felt like a while a competitive advantage .
but the middle of the '90s , we realized we now , but that we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , yes , actually started had -- to slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` the avatar . '' written , that the <unk> in things visual effects and <unk> effects in the very new heights it should , realistic about human , expressive characters , using <unk> it was were . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world to <unk> be .
but the <unk> put very beautiful . and the people in my company told me , we <unk> still not in the able to be , that to create .
so , shifted , i do that , and made these other film about the big ship , that goes .
the <unk> i think that as `` romeo and juliet on a ship . '' and sells . it was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a passionate film .
secretly , but i wanted to actually , real thing up the titanic immerse ourselves .
that i have the movie .
this is the truth . the studio , i knew that , but not .
i , but i 'm convinced , by i said , `` we were diving , to the up . we watched films that real up .
we 're going to it in the <unk> the movie .
this is incredibly important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> you , a major expedition to fund .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to that the own imagination a reality to make it can .
we created and then indeed , six months later a reality , in the time i was in a russian <unk> found , four miles of the surface of the north atlantic , and me the real titanic , through a <unk> <unk> .
that was not a film , no <unk> , that was really .
so , that has to me really blew .
and the spend on that were enormous . we had cameras and a spotlight , and everything possible building .
and i fell on the very , <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you go up in this capsule , it you in this dark , hostile environment , down , where no hope , saving is , if you do n't it yourself back to do .
and i said , `` wow , that 's as well , as if i was in a <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was it became obsessed with the study the deep ocean .
anyway , of the part , with curiosity and science to do . it was all . it was an adventure , it was a curiosity . it was pure imagination .
and it was an experience , i hollywood to do n't give you could .
because , you know , i was able to me a creature , imagine , for that we then a visual on design were . but i could i 'm not that you imagine , what i outside the <unk> would see .
at some of the following expeditions i beings in <unk> seen , and sometimes the things i still never seen before i had , sometimes , the things at all , nobody ever seen before , and for the science , at , when we do you saw , still do n't have words are found was .
that has to me so right <unk> , and i wanted more .
and so i then , something unusual decision .
and after the success of `` titanic '' said , i , `` okay , i want to my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood goes on the ice on and i 'm going for a while <unk> . ''
and then we started , we showed up to `` <unk> '' , and they were you with <unk> .
we returned to up the titanic .
we took a little robot , we built were , a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and , the inside the ship at , never before i did was .
nobody had ever been the inside the <unk> explored . you had , no means that . so developed , we the will technology .
well , and there sitting i now , the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> , this <unk> here 's quite similar , and of which i know that once the band there was playing .
and i fly with a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i <unk> it , actually just , but my consciousness is within the <unk> .
it felt , , as if i physically in the <unk> the titanic there .
that was the <unk> form of <unk> , i ever experienced . because before i one to a corner <unk> , i knew i always been , in the <unk> the <unk> that would , i months about <unk> did was , when we the movie , turned around .
that set was , which is an exact replica of <unk> the ship .
so that was a highly strange .
they made me this <unk> that you have such <unk> avatars and use and so that own consciousness in the vehicle , in this different shape the existence embarrassed .
it was really an incredibly profound
and perhaps also a small view on that , maybe in a few decades could happen , if you <unk> has to something to or other things to do , in all kinds <unk> <unk> , i told me as <unk> can imagine .
after these expeditions we started this , what we down there 've had , really appreciate them to learn , the example of these <unk> , where we these incredible , how the animals , . that are sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live with help of chemosynthesis .
they are not in the sunlight , based system , how we do that .
and so you see animals , the right next one of 500 degrees say that they there to survive .
the same time was i also very much for <unk> , that was again , the <unk> from my childhood .
and so i ended up at the people , for the space interested and the with the nasa to have and in <unk> sit and right <unk> plan . they 're driving , russia , through , the mission that <unk> protocol <unk> all the drum and on , fly and then the international <unk> and take our <unk> with .
that was fascinating .
but the end , and it to come out that i <unk> with us in the deep took .
i took you , and <unk> them access to the world down there , <unk> , <unk> , people , the , for those extreme environments in interested . i took you to the sources , with , so , you look around the samples , and instruments test that could and so forth .
we turned it documentaries , run , but actually the science , more specifically , <unk> .
so lock , the circle , between my existence as <unk> , then , as a child , and the <unk> in the reality .
in the course of as i have a lot of learned .
i have a lot about science that . but i now think they certainly , a director to also to lead , a leader be as a <unk> or so .
i understood , but not a lot of leadership , before i do this research expeditions <unk> .
because , a certain point i had to tell me , `` what i actually here ?
why i do that ? what comes and out ? ''
these stinking films to bring us no money .
we play time now , by a . of fame , not a lane .
all think , i was between , `` titanic '' and `` the avatar . '' <unk> and have to me , somewhere , of nails on a towel on the <unk> .
i 've all these films , these documentaries , for a very audience .
not a fame , not honor , no money . what you doing just ?
you do it to the task will to the challenge will -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , there 's . you do it the <unk> because , and because of weird to the amount of , if a small group of people a team is .
because we have all this with only 10 to 12 people did , for years about worked . sometimes we were two to three months a row on the lake .
and in this community you that the most important thing the warning is , you , each other , because you a task does it has , you any other things tell you can .
if you , land back and , says , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and that , around the whole technology , and the trouble , the human <unk> , if you on sea , working , '' , then you can look at the other just ca n't explain . this is the police or at these soldiers , something together through , and you know , it never met anyone can explain .
there is a connection , each other respect .
when i so back to my next movie `` the avatar . '' to turn , i tried those same <unk> to , which is that you could be a team and respected and , in return of respect , deserves .
it was the dynamics really changed .
there , i was so again with a small team on <unk> terrain . we turned out , `` the avatar . '' with a new technology , it before , not there .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were for a period of four years to a real family .
it changed , my way , films to do , completely .
it was giving people , said , we have these <unk> yes , really good <unk> and the planet pandora transport .
for me , it was more a <unk> way , my job to do , the real process , the , in the result has changed .
what we can so from all of finish ?
the lessons we 've learned ?
i think , the first place in this is the curiosity .
it 's the most human property .
our imagination is a force , even a reality to make it can .
and the warning of your team is more than all <unk> this world .
come to me boy , filmmaker , say , `` give you to me a advice , as i do something that can do . ''
and i say , `` <unk> you do n't even a .
that get , others for you . do it does n't you yourself , bet not against themselves . but to take risks on you . ''
the nasa has been so a <unk> , `` of failure is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and the study to fail , alternative to be , because there , i guarantee it 's a leap .
no big endeavor , that innovation for , ever , without risk with .
you must be willing to be , those risks on , to take .
this is the idea , i do you 'd like with the way to give you want . failure is it an alternative , fear but it 's no . thanks .
now i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and the surprise , maybe something , because , my <unk> the foundation of the vaccines , and seed is about the things , we make up and deliver to the poorest two billion a better life to .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , and even more than for every other on the planet .
<unk> mean , whose <unk> over many years n't grow . it , we need to a lot sooner or to a rain . the things are , so we change , how it their fragile environment is not withstand that can .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to the uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , is a climate change , terrible for you 're going .
and also is the <unk> for you very important .
the fact is that , if you just from one thing the price down could , to <unk> would energy , far the most effective .
now , the <unk> is about the time to like .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> towards the industrial revolution , and even in 20 . century , there 's a <unk> case in <unk> and so we have the refrigerators , <unk> , we can fully modern materials to make and so many things do .
we are so in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we the price down -- let we the price in half -- to make that we on a new barrier , and this barrier on with carbon .
co2 up the planet and the equation for carbon is actually pretty clear .
they <unk> that <unk> co2 , which to <unk> leads , and this <unk> has some very negative to follow . effects on the weather and maybe even worse , the <unk> result , the natural ecosystems , such <unk> changes not to adapt , and so the whole systems <unk> .
now , the exact correlation between a <unk> and the it <unk> <unk> and where their other consequences are , there 's some <unk> , but not very many .
and there 's safe <unk> about , how bad , those consequences will . but they 're extremely it be .
i have the <unk> times wondered : `` we really , down on the near zero to come ?
does n't the half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is : until we 're near zero to come , the temperature on up .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a 3.5 feet high truck , under a number 3 feet bridge from . the you can then sort of it from -- .
this must , after the bottom , on a zero .
now , we into every year , a lot <unk> , about the 26 billion tons .
every american about 20 tons . people from the poor countries , less than a .
in the average are 's about five million tons for every on the planet .
and somehow we have to change produce , that on a zero to lower .
it 's have a constant up .
just one of economic changes to have it all , and we need to of <unk> rise to reduction , and to a reduction in the way to the zero .
this equation , four factors . a little <unk> . they have this thing left -- the co2 -- that you towards zero to want , and this is the number of people depend , of the service , every man in the average use , the average of energy for every human services and the co2 , that a energy <unk> will .
you make us so every single factor of them look , and i think we , how we that on a zero .
probably have to a sort of these numbers very close , zero to come .
now this is the basic algebra , but we go about it 's time through .
first , we have the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people ,
and it is the nine billion to . the , on 9 billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> are we could that , to 10 percent to 15 percent down , but the time , we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second of these are the services , we use .
that involves all the food , we eat , clothing , television , heating .
that are very good things and <unk> mean , those services , almost any on the planet 's accessible to do .
it 's great , this number up .
in the rich world , in the top one billion , we might think <unk> do and less use , but in the average will this number of every year go up and , so in more than double the number of services , per person by going .
here we see a very basic services . there 's going to go home light , so you the homework can read it ?
and these students have n't it , so they go out and reading your <unk> under the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there 's finally , good news .
we have something that 's not going up ,
because of success in <unk> , through the other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there 's a lot of services , whose <unk> some of services , let me , 90 percent to reduce .
in other service , like the manufacturing of <unk> , at 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the <unk> for improvement is very much smaller .
in general , if we 're looking optimistically , are , we might be a reduction , a factor , three or maybe even to a factor of six .
but at the first three factors , we 're now of 26 billion , maybe <unk> 13 billion tons of gone . and that 's just not from .
we look so the fourth factor , -- and this is a <unk> be -- is the amount of co2 , per energy <unk> will .
it turns , the question , if you that on a zero , can .
if you coal , burning , no .
if you gas will burn , no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> , co2 , the renewables and <unk> .
so , what we on a global level to , is , a new system to create .
we need <unk> .
if i now the term `` wonders , '' i use , i 'm not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and of services is a miracle .
the people here have to the development of this miracle that contributed .
usually , there 's not a deadline , you a miracle to a certain date needs .
usually is you basically just wrong and some people come to others .
in this case , we but <unk> give and a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i think that really <unk> ?
there 's a natural <unk> , a demonstration , the idea of people here <unk> ?
i remembered , last year , when i mosquitos to and somehow i liked the people that .
the idea was for you really , tangible , you know , it , there , with mosquitos to live .
for energy , i noticed that here .
i decided that <unk> of fireflies , my <unk> contribution to the environment , here would be .
here are so a natural fireflies .
you , i told you to do n't bite . in fact , they will probably not time that glass to leave .
now , there 's all kinds <unk> like this , but they bring all not much .
we need solutions , either , or of the an incredible scaling up and incredible <unk> . and although it many ways there , in which people and then we 're , i really just five , these big needs can afford .
i tides , <unk> the merger and better biofuels out .
this afford it may be a <unk> contributions and if you better do when i expect , that would be great , but my 's here is that we , all those five to work , and we ca n't of you give up , because they us <unk> , because all have significant problems .
we 're going to look at first the burning fossil fuels , burning of either of coal or gas .
what you there are doing to , it may simply , but this is n't . you have to all the co2 , that after the burning of the <unk> comes to capture , under pressure <unk> and then place them and hope that 's there is .
there 's some well , that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level of creating , but it on 100 percent to get it 's very difficult to be . and a <unk> for the storage of co2 to produce , is a big challenge . but the problem here 's the <unk> .
who 's going to ensure that ?
who can do something i guarantee , literally , many billions of times bigger than any kind of waste , you , of <unk> and other things we can imagine ?
that 's a lot of volume .
so that 's a hard <unk> .
when the next thing : <unk> .
the also has three big problems . the cost , , especially in <unk> countries are high . the question after security , you really feel that does n't go wrong can , despite the human <unk> the fuel not for weapons 's going .
and what makes you then with the garbage ?
because even though he 's not very large is , there 's a lot about .
so three very difficult problems , maybe even soluble , are , and , which you that work should .
the last three of five , i 've summarized .
it are the renewables , often be called .
and also the have -- although it is that they didn’t have fuel need -- they have some well .
, is the <unk> , these technologies create dramatic lower than the of <unk> .
that are <unk> , you 're talking of you <unk> , a thousand times more area as a normal power .
and also be these vents <unk> .
the sun it 's not all the day , they seem to also not every day and as blows , the wind , not the time .
so you have to , if you of these vents on this is , a way to have the energy , in times when they do is available , to get .
there 's so here , <unk> . there 's the challenges in the transmission . if we example , say that the energy source of the country is , they need not just the technology , they have to also with the risk around the energy from where different from .
and there 's the <unk> .
and the dimension to show , i 've all kinds of batteries , be made , at , for cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for everything . and that i do with the amount of the electronic energy , which the world , using , compared to . i found that all the batteries , we now producing , less than 10 minutes of <unk> them could .
we need so here 's a breakthrough , something that to a factor of 100 times better will be , as the approaches to the time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not so easily .
that happens , if you 're trying to this <unk> sources , we say , 20 percent -- 30 percent of the <unk> to .
if you , 100 percent of that this want , they need a an <unk> .
now , where we going to go , what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project , '' ? how we come to target ?
what we need are many companies , it work . hundreds of .
in every one of five different areas we need at least 100 people .
, you will you say , are crazy ! that 's good .
i think , here in the ted group there 's a lot of the , there , engaged .
bill that has multiple different companies , under one of a called <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies , the great things do and interesting ways to have and i try this to support .
nathan myhrvold and i pay for a company , the , may surprise , the nuclear approach to follow .
there 's some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
the development has in this industry , some time i stopped , so it 's no big surprise , some good ideas lying .
that <unk> means that you instead of a part of <unk> , the one percent , that <unk> , we decided to the 99 percent to burn , that <unk> .
this is quite a crazy idea .
but actually had you about , long time thinking , but you could never been properly simulate , whether it would work , but since it modern supercomputer , there , you 're and see that : yeah ! with the right <unk> , it looks like , that it <unk> .
and because you , 99 percent of burning , is that <unk> very much better .
actually burning , you the garbage , and you can even the waste from one of them as <unk> use .
instead , about the head to break , burn it 's easy . a great thing .
that are uranium is <unk> uses , a little bit like a candle that .
you see that 's a way that pillar is , often than `` traveling wave of reactor . '' called .
that solve really the <unk> .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , 99 percent . you has the part , today , you burn it 's going to <unk> so called it <unk> uranium .
that <unk> the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you <unk> cheap and just <unk> , you have fuel for the rest of lifetime of the planet .
you know , there 's still many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts , we need to move to come .
think we , how we do our success to measure to .
how to our own testimony to look like ?
now , we go to the goal , that we do to , and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
many speak of an 80 percent reduction , until 2050 .
it 's really very important , we go into .
the rest of 20 percent are in poor countries , will , and still something that agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and cement to clean .
so , to these 80 percent to reach , to the developed countries , including those countries like china , their <unk> completely <unk> .
the other note she says , whether we the <unk> technology to use , if you in all the developed countries used this is , and we the way that are , you to the rest to get .
that 's great .
this is a <unk> this <unk> .
if we from there back , how to that by 2020 testament to look like ?
it should be back the two elements of .
we should be the <unk> use to which the way to . the less we <unk> , <unk> low is the <unk> , and so , the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things , we company , not completely to the big <unk> , just in fact , or even something less important as the other , which the speed of innovation for this amazing breakthroughs that .
this amazing breakthroughs , we have to deal with <unk> track and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there 's many great books to this issue .
that al gore 's book `` we have the choice '' and david <unk> `` <unk> energy <unk> the about the air . ''
they go it really , and create a frame , in the this broad of can be , because we need to support of all sides .
there 's a few things that come together .
this is a wish .
a very <unk> wish that we do this technology to invent .
if they told me just a wish for the next 50 years to allow , i could the president to pick , a <unk> , and that i love , i could this desire to vote , which is , <unk> <unk> no carbon is being invented . this desire to take me .
this has the biggest impact .
if we have this desire to do n't get , the dig in between the long and the short <unk> people awful potential to , between the u.s. and china , between the poor and the rich countries . and almost all life of these two billion are very much worse .
what we have to so i do ?
for the things <unk> i ?
we need to for more context in .
if countries , in places like <unk> meet , they should not just about carbon .
they should these <unk> talk , and they were shocked by the ridiculous , low money , for these innovative approaches spent .

we need to the message to spread .
we need to dialogue <unk> and the entire lead and also the things , from the government done .
it 's a very important for , but i think , we can give him meet .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you . only to <unk> something better to understand -- first , you us a notion of scale of investment to be ?
bill gates : the simulation on a supercomputer to do , all the great scientist to get , what we 've done , we just some 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian reactor tested have to ensure that it properly works , is you just in the <unk> million .
the hard to step is that build the first <unk> , another billion to find the <unk> and the place of fact , the first of building .
once the first done is , if he was that 's like i promised , everything is very clear , because the <unk> , the <unk> is so , <unk> , how we do you know .
the right to understand : that deep in the floor to almost like a vertical pillar of a nuclear <unk> , this <unk> <unk> and then start with the process , up and works , and after the bottom ?
bg : exactly . now you have to the reactor , new <unk> , so there 's many people and many is , go wrong . this thing where you know it opens and stuff <unk> or going . that 's not good !
if you , but very cheap fuel , you can tell him for 60 years <unk> -- you think , a pillar -- the you 've been buried , without the whole <unk> .
and it 's sitting there , and <unk> 60 years long and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , even a solution for the waste , it .
bg : yeah . now , with the garbage is happening : you can give him sitting , let 's -- there 's much less than waste , with this method -- then take you give him and grab him in the reactor and burn it on .
and we start , by we the garbage can take the already exists , in these <unk> or <unk> the reactors is . this is our <unk> .
so this is that , for these reactors operate a problem was that , what we in our fill and so that will <unk> dramatically reduce during this process .
but while you with different people this world about these are 've talked ,
where it 's the interest , so what really to implement ?
bg : well , we still not on a place <unk> and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is wearing . there 's big interest and the people the company was in russia , india , china -- i was here and have the <unk> met , and talking about it , like this to <unk> does .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese who have something in the direction .
this is a variation in one thing , was done .
this is a more step forward , but it 's like a faster the reactor and some countries have these are built , why is everybody , a rapid reactor implemented , a <unk> for our first .
in your idea : <unk> and the probability that something really into your life to shout out ?
bg : well , we need one of <unk> , <unk> the things , which are , we have 20 years , for reinventing and then 20 years to use .
that 's sort of the deadline , the us the <unk> demonstrated that has , we <unk> .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything well it , and that 's a desire to be that easy .
and fortunately , there 's now , dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of the , as well , if their approaches to work , for for your pilots to work , for <unk> .
and it would be the best , if it 's several do , because then you could be a mixture of use .
, we need a solution .
about the big one of major breakthroughs , this is the issue that you know ?
bg : a <unk> is that <unk> .
that would it , without the <unk> been , but the power 's still so much more important .
in a nuclear sector , there 's another , innovative companies .
you know , we know whose work , not so well , like this , but there 's the up a way , that 's a other way .
there 's a fluid <unk> , which is something hard to , but you might say , that 's about us .
and so there 's different , but this beautiful it is that a <unk> a million times so much energy has a bit like , we say , a <unk> and so , if you with the problems around , and the are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in a own league table .
if that does n't , then what ?
we have to <unk> come to try to the <unk> stable enough to hold ?
bg : if you in this situation is coming , it 's as if you to be much eating , and short years ago , a heart is . what makes you then ? you need to maybe a <unk> or anything .
there 's a <unk> the , <unk> called the , with various techniques into the warming , to delay , so we 20 or 30 years longer had to us <unk> .
that 's just a <unk> .
you hope that we do n't need .
some people say , you should not only , the insurance to work , because a that might be lazy power , so you and eats , because you know that a the <unk> save them will .
i do n't know if that smart , is , if you , the importance of this problem , eyes , leads , but there 's now a discourse in <unk> about , if you that to have to , if the things faster , coming , this innovation longer need , when we expect .
change , you have a or two sentences for the to you may be able to convince them ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics in very different <unk> .
the ones , the scientific arguments do , are very little .
they say that 's negative effects , there , with the clouds to have the things here ?
there 's very , very few things , they all say , of which it 's a chance in a million there .
that <unk> here 's like , aids .
you do the mistake now , and you pay for very much later .
and why is the idea , now , if you all kinds <unk> problems , in something to invest , of you only later , what has -- and to come to the investment is not that is clear . actually is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst scenario and there 's people in the rich world , the , ipcc look and say , okay , that 's not a drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty of us about being able to be .
but my dream , here is that , if you do it , economic can do , and at the co2 cleaned up , say , the skeptics , `` okay , it 's interested me not that 's no carbon <unk> , i wish i almost , it that did , but i 'm going to it probably not accept , because it 's cheaper , is as the previous one way . ''
and that would be your answer on the <unk> <unk> argument that , if you all this time and energy use the co2 problem to solve , all the other targets it from the <unk> , the proper level of malaria and so that 's a dumb waste of resources that 's the money to invest , while it better , there , we can do .
bg : well , what actually spending for the research -- we say the u.s. to 10 billion per year , more to spend when they do today -- that 's not so dramatically .
it should be other things do n't suffer .
you come then to the great <unk> , and here we can make reasonable people disagree , if you something , that 's not economic is , and tried , that to fund . for me that 's happening here the most of waste .
it was because , you is very short years ago , a <unk> and they were only still the curve . i think we should be more things are trying to the potential to have , very much cheaper .
if the <unk> , you get , a very high <unk> is , you can only the rich and keep up .
i mean , each of us here , five times , so much for our energy on without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> thinking .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research is not more comfortable talking about ? ''
he 's still , because of its former stories , with the <unk> associated , but he has understood that a very lonely one group is , and that brings he now that <unk> .
and that 's a <unk> , i for them think .
the research , it 's just nuts , how little the support is .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i 'm really , her wish that 's going . you , thank you .
bg : thanks .
some years ago , here at ted , and peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is pretty straightforward . <unk> to the then <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about . <unk> tape , about . <unk> thread and a marshmallow , building .
the marshmallow to on top .
and , though it really just seems , it 's actually really hard , because it people and urges very quickly work together .
and so i thought , that this is an interesting idea is , and i do it in a <unk> into .
it was a huge success .
since i 've been talking about 70 workshops world 's done , with students , <unk> and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there 's something , this task , deep impressions , in the nature of working together to and i want some of them to share with you .
usually to the most people , in the task to orient .
they 're talking about , you think , how it looks like this is , they <unk> to power ,
then we invest , a little time in planning and organization . they 're drawing and put <unk> .
they invest in a lot of their time in the <unk> time <unk> structures
and finally , just before they no time , have to take anyone in the marshmallow and they put him gently into the top , to a step back and `` <unk> '' ! i admire , their work .
what but then , almost always , what happens is that the `` <unk> '' to a `` <unk> '' is , because the weight of <unk> does that the whole thing , <unk> and <unk> .
there 's a series of people , much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have more than others , and under the worst are totally fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and make really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there 's also had teams , much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have and under the best are totally fresh alumni of <unk> .
and that 's pretty amazing .
like us , peter told to make you 're not just the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask , is : how come that ? why ? what about where ?
and peter 's telling : `` none of children to invest time in the head of <unk> <unk> to be . ''
they invest , no time in <unk> .
but there 's still a whole other reason .
and it , <unk> trained , the a real plan to find , ok !
and it , then to realize .
then what happens , if you the marshmallow for the top and grab , they have no time , and what ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what <unk> do differently is that they with the marshmallow and start and prototypes to build , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow , the top , so that they times the opportunity to have <unk> prototypes to fix .
<unk> recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of <unk> <unk> .
and with every attempt to get the children <unk> feedback , what works and what do n't .
so this is the performance , prototypes to work , much -- but we see again , how different teams operate .
the average for the most is at about . <unk> , <unk> create the half of the lawyers do something more , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , , .
<unk> is the highest , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they are triangles , understanding and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to make stable structures to build .
ceos are something about the average . but here 's interesting .
of you a <unk> administrator at the team , you going to dramatically better .
it 's unbelievable . you see , and see , `` this team going to win . ''
you can the predictions . why is that ?
because they particular skills of <unk> .
they run the process , you understand him .
and that team , that <unk> and the work of attention to the performance of teams dramatically improve .
<unk> skills and <unk> and their combination of lead to success .
if you 10 teams have the unique to do , you ca . six , stable and we have .
i tried to now , exciting .
i thought , bring , we <unk> the same .
so she offered that i have a <unk> dollars a price , software for the winner .
what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was the outcome ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone who 's a <unk> of construction , built have to have thought he the price to home by .
it 's so i do n't really interesting , high <unk> a strong effect have ?
we would this exercise with the students .
what you think happened now ?
well understood you the advantage of `` <unk> . ''
so , from the same , for team of them under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least some time .
there 's so <unk> lessons for us , about the nature of incentive and success .
you might ask : why would anyone in fact , invest in a <unk> to create ?
the reason is , i 'll help digital tools and processes to create , to teams to help , cars , video and `` <unk> <unk> '' to create .
and what the <unk> does is , they 're going to help them , hidden assumptions about to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own the marshmallow .
the challenge and offers a shared experience , a common language , or . <unk> , the right prototype to build .
and this is the value of experience , this is so simple exercise .
and those of them , it 's interested , <unk> visit .
it 's a blog , where you see , as you the <unk> .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find a crazy examples from all the world , how people , the system to optimize and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is the structure actually a <unk> sports .
it in order , we all our senses , the task to and that we think about the optimal use , like our feelings and we do , in the challenge , of us is .
and sometimes is a small prototype this experience all , what it needs to us from a `` <unk> '' -- to a `` <unk> '' moment to .
and that can a big difference .
thank you .
we do so when we have here 's a machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a machine .
and everybody in this room must .
and you can in the past go , you can in the future , go ; they can not in here and now to stay ,
and i ask me , what they vote would , because i my friends in the last time of this question i asked you have , and they all in the past go .
i do n't know . they wanted to the time , before it cars , or twitter or `` america for the superstar . ''
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you kind of the nostalgia , to <unk> <unk> is .
and that i .
i 'm not part of this group , i must say .
i do n't want to the past , and that 's not , because i 'm a explorers i 'm --
it is that are on this planet does n't go back , you go forward .
i want so in this machine , and i want to the future , go .
this is the greatest time , it ever attempted on this planet , there , whatever , what scale , they make , health , wealth , mobility , the opportunities , declining <unk> .
it was never before a time , like this .
my <unk> died , when they were 60 were .
my grandparents who this number on 70 .
my parents are the of the <unk> .
there should be so much better a nine the beginning of my <unk> .
but it 's not time to people like us , because this is a lot more thing than that .
a kid , that today in delhi , born , can expect , so long to live as the richest man on the 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox have a billion people on this planet killed .
they have the demographics of the earth , on a way the new , shaped the way that 's no war , ever done .
they 're way . they 're gone .
we have you <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world there 's disease , the millions of us , just one generation , threatened to have to do n't yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
i know all , anybody what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability , billion people to feed , that are real successes the scientific method .
and from my view is the scientific method , things to try to look , whether it works , it will change , if it does n't that does , the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , that 's been around the good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they were often mentioned ,
and one of this is , despite all our greatest achievements a billion people on this world every day hungry , to bed , go .
this number up , and they 're going up very quickly , and that 's embarrassing .
and not only that , we have our imagination to be used to this world do to your .
drinking water , <unk> country , the rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , and it soon , and if we 're not from this chaos <unk> disappear , we also .
so the question is : we can do that ? i think .
i think it is that we food can produce the billion people feed them will , without the country , the they live , to rape survivor .
i think , we can this world with energy to feed , they 're not the same time , destroyed .
i think that really , and no , that 's not <unk> .
but that here 's holding me at night up -- one of the things me at night awake . we have the science progress , never been so desperately to like now , still never ,
and we were also still never in the able to it properly <unk> , we do it today .
we are , the threshold to the amazing , amazing events on many areas . and yet , i really , we are hundreds , 300 years ago , the enlightenment , back to have to a time to find , in the we progress so we have , in the way we think about these things <unk> <unk> have , more <unk> as now .
the people <unk> , in their , and it 's so closely , you do n't you free .
not time the truth will you free .
and you , everybody has a right on its own opinion , even a right on its own opinion , progress ,
but you know , what they 're not quite have ?
they have no right on their facts . <unk> , you have n't .
and i have a while needed to that out .
ago about a decade , i have a paper , vaccination , `` the new yorker , '' written , a little paper .
and i was amazed to the resistance to go into , the resistance to the , at the most effective activity in health in the history of humanity .
i did n't know , what i should do , so i did just what i always doing , i wrote a paper and went on .
and soon after that i wrote a paper about <unk> changed the food .
the same thing , only bigger .
the people were playing .
so i also about a articles written , and i could n't understand , why the people thought , that would `` <unk> '' , why they believed that the molecules on a certain of a random kind <unk> a <unk> on the area of nature .
but you know , i 'm doing what i do . i wrote the articles , i did on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we type , we 're rich , we go food , that 's okay .
but these articles were told me to care , and i could n't find out , why , and eventually i found it turns out .
and this is that these <unk> , me nuts were doing does n't <unk> were .
that were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me that mess ...
but then i thought , you know what to be we 're honest ,
we are , a point where , the we 're not the same relationship to progress , how much earlier .
we 're talking <unk> .
we 're talking ironic of them , with a little <unk> about , `` no progress . ''
okay , that there 's the reasons , and i think we know , which one that are .
we have this faith in institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science , lost , and there 's no reason , why that 's not so to be .
you can just a name call and the people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , of mass , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can your list vote .
there 's ask , and problems with the people , of which we believed that they always right to have . be so they have skepticism .
imagine if you ask , for you some evidence , for you evidence .
take you ca n't as a given to myself .
but now it 's : if you evidence to get you have to this evidence to assume , and it , we 're not good .
and i can that out of the reason to say that we now in an epidemic of fear of life , as i they still never seen have and hopefully will never again , you 'll .
ago about 12 years was a story came out , a terrible story , the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in the connection .
very frightening .
tons of studies have been done to see if that was true .
tons of studies to be done to be ; that 's a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in , from the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no link , not .
it does n't make a difference . it does n't matter , because we , anecdotes , we think , what we see , what we need to see , what does that we really feel .
we do n't think , a bunch documents from a <unk> , of us data , there , and i understand that , i think that do we all .
but you know what ?
the outcome of it was <unk> ,
<unk> because of the fact , the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world , in the the immunization , <unk> down .
that 's absolutely scandalous and we should be ashamed .
it 's awful .
what happened that we do we could n't .
now , i understand that . that do i .
because , here somebody <unk> ?
has a single in the audience ever find someone , <unk> die see ?
it 's not very often .
what happens in this country does n't , but the 160,000 time in the world in the last year .
that are lots of death by <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because that 's not happening here is , we can it out , and people like jenny mccarthy , we can walk around and messages of fear and illiteracy , platforms like the oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and the correlation was not connecting .
they understand not that these things in to seem , but almost never the same thing .
and it 's something that we learn to , and it very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he was liberated us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
not afraid , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , gone .
the guy in the middle , not so you .
he is paul <unk> .
he has just with a few other people a <unk> .
he can the lives of <unk> , 500,000 in children per year in the developing to save .
pretty well , not ?
now , that 's good , besides some of that , paul around and over the vaccines , talks , and says , how valuable they are , and that the people just stop should be able to <unk> .
and that says he actually so .
paul 's so a terrorist .
if paul in a public <unk> talks , he ca n't , armed <unk> statements .
he gets calls home , because the people to him to tell you to know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul a <unk> has done .
i need that does n't say , but the vaccines are essential .
you take you on , let the disease , terrible disease , and that 's happening now .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and this is worse , and pretty soon be children back to that die , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just , <unk> die .
what about <unk> ? we take that . why not ?
a <unk> of me has to me a few weeks ago i wrote , and told you think i 'm a little to <unk> .
nobody has that ever before i said .
they would their kid 's not against <unk> immunized . on not any case .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't <unk> . and you know what ?
we had in this country , yesterday , no <unk> .
now , i do n't know , maybe she now this morning , somebody in lagos , in a plane and going to just to go to los angeles , the moment he 's about ohio .
and in a few hours goes , he and <unk> a car , and he comes after a long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> today at night and visit .
and he does n't know that he 's with a <unk> disease by this is , and we know that 's also not , because that works in the world now time .
this is the planet , the we live . they do n't so , as if he did n't that 's .
we love it , us in a lie to <unk> . we love that .
they have today morning , all their vitamins taken ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that you on the can help .
i know , that they 've done , because half the americans , that every day .
you take this stuff , and they take an alternative to cure , and it does n't matter , how often we find out that they 're useless .
the data to give the time .
they <unk> their urine . do more you almost never .
that 's okay , they want to 28 billion dollars for the dark , urine of numbers .
i voice you completely .
dark urine . dark .
why do we that ? why do we that ?
now , i think , i -- we hate the industry .
we hate , to strong government . we have no faith in the system .
and that we should also not . our healthcare system is in .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> itself to us , it can afford .
we walk , so before that way , and where to walk , we ?
we walk in the poor the <unk> .
that 's great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , that 's really a serious issue , because this stuff is crap , and we give a billion dollars for .
and i 've all kinds of little through here .
n't matter of -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , cheating , <unk> , i do n't time , what that is , but we give a billion dollars for , it 's cheating .
and you know what ? when i think that 's say , shouting at me the people , and say , `` what looks after it you ? let the people , but do , what they want .
so you feel , well . ''
and you know what ? they 've been wrong .
because it makes me , whatever is , if it is the minister is , says , `` hmm , i 'm going to the evidence of experts to mammography does n't assume , '' or any <unk> , his patients with <unk> treat .
if you on this way to , where i think , and the magic of evidence and science to replace , get you , a place , the they do n't want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he got 400,000 its people to , because he thought that was that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more than any antiretroviral drugs are , of which we know that you the course of aids , the brakes .
hundreds of <unk> deaths in a country , the worse than any other of this disease <unk> will .
they tell me , please do n't that these things do n't have consequences .
the have you . the they 've always .
now , the <unk> epidemic , in the we just are , is this ridiculous , struggle between the <unk> <unk> <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about the metaphor .
that 's anti-israeli ideology , not science .
everything , what we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , everybody 're , of the people changed .
you know , there 's no <unk> in the garden .
there 's no <unk> .
there 's no christmas . we 've all this .
we have it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of has to work and some of it 's not .
we 're getting rid of , what do n't work .
now we can it more detail . and of course there 's the risks . but we can see something like vitamin a , in rice , do , and this stuff can million people to help , million people , their lives to prolong life .
that you want to do n't do ?
i have to say , that i do n't .
we lean <unk> changed the food .
why do we that ?
now , what i always hear is : to a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't want to the huge areas with one thing that 's wrong .
we do n't want to companies who live in the patent .
we do n't want to companies seeds .
and you know , my answer on all this is ?
yes , right . fix , that .
it 's true , we have a <unk> , but that 's not science .
that has with science has nothing to do .
it 's right , morality , <unk> .
you know that the science is not a company .
you is no country .
she 's not time an idea ; she 's a process .
she 's a process , and sometimes work , and he and sometimes not , but the idea that we the science is not allow you should , their work to do , because we 're afraid to have is a really dead , and they 're holding the millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we 're going to 70 percent more food grow to as the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need that , and we give it you do n't .
and why ? <unk> changed the food .
we want people do encourage , this <unk> stuff to eat , like the example <unk> .
<unk> is something that half a billion people eat .
it 's about how a potato .
it 's just a bunch calories . it 's mies .
it has n't require nutrients , it has not a protein , and scientists building that all right now at a .
and then we could have the people that food and would n't be blind be .
they would n't starving , and you know what ?
that would you . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would you .
and everything , what i 'm going to say , is : why fight , that ?
i mean , we ask : why fight , that ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about the genes <unk> . it 's not to chemicals .
it 's not to our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> on the greater food , better food , unique food .
it 's here 's not to the rice <unk> , it 's about , the life to get , and it 's the highest time , to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't that do , if we so on doing as far , we make us , something guilty , the we , i believe , not guilty want to be , high-tech colonialism .
there 's no other description for that , what happened here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our not worthy , and we need to that really stop .
after this incredible , kind of entertainment want you so you might say , you still in this ridiculous machine , and the future , go ? ''
, . that i want to do , .
the moment is you in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can this machine on all imagine , what we want .
we can you <unk> , where we do you <unk> want , and we 're going to you get there are moving , where we want .
we need to these conversations , and we need to think , but if we in the machine , up , and the future , we will be happy to be , that made .
i know that we do it can , and as it takes me in terms of this is something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time interested , i for the <unk> . it may strangely appear to , a magician that interested , it was because , you look at it 's so how i , `` a deception , to something real is , if someone just , enough that thinks . ''
other words , <unk> have in some studies have a measurable effect that , the <unk> , and it just so , because the person thinks , with her going to be a <unk> or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , there 's , if the patient 's just , enough that thinks , a measurable effect in the body , you the <unk> called .
a deception is going to something real , because somebody 's like seeing .
so we 're also understanding , i want you now a fundamental , very simple trick .
and i 'm going to show you how he works . this is a trick , the least for the 1950s , in any <unk> for children 's .
i even have him from <unk> <unk> magic of <unk> in the 1970s , learned .
i 'm going to him for you do and it , then .
and then i 'm going to why i do it , let me .
so , you see , what happens .
that knife , that they 're looking at can ; my hand , they study .
i 'm going to the knife just so in my off .
i <unk> my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve away , or from him out , i 'm just my wrist , right here <unk> .
on this way you can see that , to none of time , anything you move . as i 'm here <unk> , i ca n't in my sleeve hiking , or out .
and the goal and it 's very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if all good about , is that knife by my bare physical <unk> that .
it 's actually so , , his room , it to shake it can , without that knife <unk> .
nothing goes in my sleeve , or come out , no <unk> . and you can all .
<unk> !
so , that 's a trick , i often a little kids <unk> , the , for magic interested , because you can and very much about being able to , if you more specifically looking , though it 's a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably know many of you here in the room watching this trick .
he works like this :
i think that knife in my hand .
i say , my wrist <unk> , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve away , or out , and that 's a lie .
the reason , why i my wrist <unk> , is the , at the real secret of the illusion is .
in the moment , which , where i mean by hand of you <unk> , so they can you of the back to see , moves , this one finger and here , my <unk> , just from there , where he was , in a position , in the he was so <unk> is .
's trick ?
back there is someone , not a childhood had .
so , he is , here . right .
and when i <unk> , changing the finger at its position .
and now you could talk about it , why that a deception is , why you do n't seeing that down here just three fingers to see are , because the mind , and the way he that process , they 're not one counts , one , two , three , but you as a group .
but it 's now here 's actually do n't . and then you open , i mean by hand .
now , it 's there that , but not by the <unk> my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , now there is .
and when i mean by hand 'll conclude , what happens to the same thing , by i <unk> , going through this movement 's the finger , again <unk> .
i guess these hand away . and here is the knife .
this trick , they can your friends and to demonstrate . thanks .
now , what has this with the <unk> to do ?
a year ago or so , i read a study , i really blew .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and so i was that for me an amazing thing .
it , which is what turned out , if you a <unk> in the form a white pill to offer , in the form of <unk> , is that just a round , white pill , a measurable effect .
but if you the shape , in the you that <unk> give , for instance , in a smaller pill to change , and these blue dyed , and a letter that <unk> , is they actually , measurable more .
and that , though , no matter of any <unk> -- it are just <unk> .
but a white ball is not so well as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really freak .
it was , but that this is still not everything is .
if you capsules take , are the more effective than the pills , every form .
a colored the capsule , the , a end of the yellow and the other red is that 's better than a white capsule .
also the <unk> plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not so well as three pills -- and i ca now , not , the exact statistics , remember . doing , i 'm sorry .
the key , but is , `` ...
... that 's also the <unk> play a role .
and the form of play a role .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to , you have to the needle in your grasp .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance , you a patient gets into .
that creates a very powerful image in my head . this is very much more than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to you a different time to show , if we have a <unk> .
the fact , so this is that the white pill , not so good does like the blue pill , not so well it as a time capsule , not so good does like the needle .
and nothing of it has some really <unk> property . it 's only we believe that , in us a stronger effect and .
i want to know if i do this idea for a trick to be .
i suspect something that obviously a deception is , and i 'll let 's really look .
we know , from the study that you to the needle in them to , if it to the whole thing to go to .
this is a 18 , two long <unk> . you is very , <unk> . and i 'm going to you first of a little <unk> .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not <unk> from hollywood .
i 'm now this needle in my skin stick and by you through and , until you on the other , again <unk> .
if you an evil to -- if they easily in <unk> fall -- i think that 's a few friends , the last night in the hotel <unk> , and some people , i did n't know , and it 's a woman , almost <unk> .
i 'm so ago , if you very quickly , and evil , is , then you look for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm going to the first <unk> part here in the back .
you can it in see , you can but also <unk> , if you want .
so , it 's so , right here , where my flesh to start , the bottom of my <unk> i 'm just a little <unk> do .
do i really sorry . makes you that 's crazy ?
and now , just a little bit through my skin and on the other so back out .
now we 're actually in the same situation , we the <unk> had .
about .
but now we can you my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , i 'm going to show you . that 's a , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know what the people think , if you see that .
they say , `` okay , is determines it 's not so stupid and <unk> , the skin , only to us a few minutes long to talk . ''
now , then i 'm it will show you .
look like this from here ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and the people back to say , `` okay . i think that 's not right . ''
the people in the <unk> come now in .
you make it me give them from the near .
this is really my skin . this is not <unk> from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can that <unk> .
do i 'm sorry . if you an evil , is , if you look at the way , you look not .
the people back or the , that later at once the video to see , will say , `` well , that looks yes , impressive , but if it 's really would , would he -- you see , here 's a hole and there , if it really , it , it would bleed . ''
okay , let me tell you a blood for you <unk> .
yes , here is it .
normally would i now the needle take .
i would my arm safe and show you , there 's not the wounds .
but i think , in this on here and with the intention , from one of being something real laughs to do , i 'm going to the needle is just in there 's and so the stage to go .
we 're going in the next days , a few times face .
i hope , you look forward , already on .
everybody talks about today about that happiness .
i have some people the number of books just let the , `` <unk> '' in the title , in the last five years out , and they gave after about 40 on , and there 's still much more .
there 's a massive wave of interest , very lucky , explorers .
there 's very much <unk> .
everybody would like the people are happier .
but despite all of flood of work , there 's several different cognitive fall , it , almost impossible to do , clear about happiness , thinking .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive fall .
this is true for <unk> , about their own happiness to think , and it is true for scientists around the lucky to think , because , it turns out that we just like this mess that are like each other .
the first of falling is a <unk> , complexity , admitting this .
it turns , that the word `` happiness is simply not a useful word , is , because we do it on to many different things to .
i think , there 's a particular meaning , the we do it to be , but in large , and all this is something that we give up to be , and we 're going to the complicated view would have to that the well-being is .
the second case is a <unk> of experience and memory , in basically made of you between be happy in his life and be happy about to live or happy with his life .
and this are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the idea from happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the <unk> fact that we 're not about a that 's think , the well-being , , without its importance to warp .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there 's simply no way , it right to get .
now i would like with a sample of start of someone , a <unk> had to of my lectures , a story <unk> . [ unclear ... '' ] , he said , he had a symphony of , and it was absolutely <unk> music , and , the end of the problem is there 's a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then we added , he 's add , really quite an emotionally , that has the whole experience was ruined .
but that had n't .
what it had was the memories , the experience .
he had the experience i had .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
they <unk> not , because he with a memory <unk> was ; the memory that was ruined , and the memory that was all , what he wants to keep going to get had .
what makes us that really says is that we about us and about other people think we could in terms of two ways of yourself .
there 's a <unk> , that in the presence of living and the present to know , capable of this is the past back to see , but in basically just the present .
it 's the <unk> , that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor , asks : `` do now it hurts , when i do you here <unk> ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> , and that <unk> itself is that , that <unk> and the story of our lives up , you get , and it 's <unk> , that the doctor <unk> by he the question it , `` how do you have , in the last time i felt like ? ''
or `` how it was their journey , albania ? '' or so similar .
this are two very different entities that <unk> , and that <unk> , and the two to confuse it 's part of the <unk> the <unk> from happiness .
so , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that starts really begin with a basic reaction , on our memories , -- it begins immediately .
we tell you 're not only tell stories , if we that make the stories to tell .
our memory and tells us stories , that means , what we of our <unk> keep to 's a story .
and let you <unk> with a sample of start .
there 's an old one study .
that are real patients , the , a painful procedure put them .
i 'm not going into detail , go . you is today are not more painful , but she was painful , as this study in the 1990s , did was .
they were asked , all over 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and here are two patients . that are your records .
and they 're asking : `` who of those who has more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient to b , clearly , suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient is a , had had the patient to b , and more .
but now there 's a different question : `` how very thought that these patients , <unk> ? ''
and here 's a surprise ,
and the surprise is that patient is a , a lot <unk> <unk> , the <unk> had a patient to b .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very where part of the story is , ending up --
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but a sort of them is this clearly ...
but a sort of them is the worse than the other .
and the , the worse is was the , where the pain , the end on his peak . it 's a bad history .
how do we know that ?
because we these people after their <unk> asked to have , and also much later , `` how it was the whole thing in general ? `` well ,
and she was much worse for a , as well , b in the <unk> .
so , that 's a direct conflict between the <unk> , and the <unk> itself .
of view of <unk> even had to b is a <unk> time .
now , what you with the patient is a , could do , and we 've actually clinical experiments done , and it 's made been , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of the patient is a to prolong by showing you just the up in it makes no , very , him to up .
this is going to the patient is one , but just a little bit and much less than before .
and if you that a few minutes long does , you does that <unk> themselves from the patient is a bad on this is , and you , does that <unk> themselves from the patient is a lot better on this is , because now , you have the patient is a , a better story about his experience , given .
<unk> being , a story from ?
and this is true for the stories that memory of us that provides and it is also for the stories we invent .
<unk> , a story <unk> are <unk> , great moments and the end .
end of these are very , very important and in this case <unk> the end .
so , that <unk> itself alive to live in continuously .
it has moments of <unk> , a after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're looking for always been lost .
i mean , the most moments of life -- and i have this out -- you know , the psychological present is true than about three seconds long . what i mean , you know , it in a life about 600 million of there . in a month there 's about 600,000 , the most of you leave not a lane .
the most of you 're completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet , they sort of the impression that they count really should , what the course of those moments of <unk> happens to our lives .
it 's the limited resource , we use as we 're on this world .
and how we they consume it would seem important to be , but that 's not the story , that <unk> even for us to keep .
so we that <unk> , and that <unk> , and they 're really quite different .
the difference between them is the -- with time .
of view of <unk> , if you a vacation might have and the second one week , so good is how the first , is the <unk> vacation twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
so does that does n't for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation n't get better than the <unk> on , because there 's no new memories , added to be .
they have the story does n't changed .
and on this way is time , the critical variable , a <unk> itself is different from a <unk> itself . time has very little bit on this story .
so , that <unk> itself , more , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's actually <unk> , the making it , because if you a patient who have the , we say , two <unk> , two different surgeons had and , decide , which he would choose to , is the , she of the memory , the less bad , is , and this is the surgeon , selected which are going .
that <unk> itself has no voice in this election .
actually choose , we 're not between <unk> . we choose between the memories , experiences .
and even if we , the future thinking , we think , our future n't normally when experiences .
we think about our future , as <unk> memories .
and in basically , they can that at , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> , and you can , that <unk> even think more than one , that sort of that <unk> even <unk> through experience , that <unk> themselves do n't need .
i have the impression that if we on doing this very often the case is that means , we do on vacation largely sitting in the services , the <unk> itself .
and that 's a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , very <unk> we of our memories ?
this is a kind of explanations , for the dominance of <unk> myself been going .
and when i think about , i think , a vacation , we have a few years ago in the west antarctica 've done , clearly the best on was , i ever had , and i think is often it in the relationship to how often i , other <unk> think .
and i 've probably from my memory , these <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes long , in the last four years <unk> .
now , when i ever since the folder open , with the 600 of it , i would have a more hour spent .
so , that are three weeks , and that are its half hours .
there it seems a disagreement , to be .
now , i like a little extremely be , you know , it , how little appetite , i on the <unk> of memories have , but itself , if you more of doing that 's a real question . why we give memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we <unk> be ?
so , i want you about a thought experiment to think .
imagine if you your next on ago , you know that the <unk> all their pictures <unk> , and they get a <unk> drug , so that you , nothing to remind you 're going .
now , you to the same vacation vote ?
and if you a other on to vote would , there 's a conflict between your two ways of yourself and they have to think about , this conflict to decide , and that 's really does not obvious , because if you in terms of time thinking , you get an answer . and if you in terms of memories , think you could have a different answer .
why we the <unk> choose , we chose this is a problem , that , we do it with a choice between the two ways of yourself .
now , the two ways of ourselves take two words from happiness .
there 's actually two concepts , from the lucky , we can use , one per product itself .
you can so , as happy there is the <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask : how happy , are the moments in life of <unk> itself ?
and they 're all -- happiness for those moments , is a quite complicated process .
which are the emotions , measured that can be ?
and the way , we 're now capable of a pretty good idea to get from happiness , the <unk> yourself over the time .
if you after the lucky , the <unk> yourself questions , it 's a very different thing .
this is not of them , as happy as a person who lives .
it 's about them , as happy or up the person is , if this person about their lives , think .
very different term .
everybody , these words , not from going to the exploration of happiness up , and i am to a lot of researchers about comfort , the exploration of happiness , long screwed that have on exactly this kind .
the distinction between the lucky , the <unk> , and the average happiness in the <unk> itself is in the last years , i realized that was , and now , an effort you , the two <unk> to measure .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , the more than a half million people ask the been are about , what you about her life thinking and about their experiences . and there 's another efforts in the direction .
in the last few years , we have so i started , the lucky , both ways of myself to learn .
and the an lesson , we , i believe 've learned is that they really differently .
you can know , as happy somebody with his life is , and that teaches you really not a lot about , as happy , he would be live lives and around .
only to them a sense of the correlation to convey the correlation there 's about <unk> .
what that means is , if you who make , and you would tell you , oh , to his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about its size know ?
well , they would be something about its size , but there 's much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i 'm going to say that somebody to be life than eight on a scale of 10 <unk> , you have much uncertainty about , as happy , he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know something about what the average happiness in the <unk> .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is basically means , very pleased to be with people , we like the time to spend with people , we like .
there 's another , pleasure , but that 's dominant society .
so if you that happiness , the two ways of myself to maximize that we want you going to the end very different things do .
the implication of the , what i 'm here said , i have is that we 're lucky , really not going to be as a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely another term .
now , very short , another reason , from the we 're not clear about happiness to think we can is that we 're not on the same things look if we about the life thinking , and if we actually life .
so if you the simple question to ask , as happy the people in california are you will not the correct answer .
if you this ask you think that the people in california to be happier to , if you , we say , in ohio life .
and what happens is , if you about that live in california to think , you think , the difference between the california , and other places , and this difference is , we say , in the climate .
well , it turns , that climate is not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful , that decide , as happy people are .
now , but , because the thoughtful itself is responsible , you the end -- some people could the end , california to .
and it 's sort of interesting to track , what happens with people , to california to the hope , happier .
now , you <unk> themselves will not happy .
we know that .
but a thing will happen . they 're thinking , happier , are , because if you think about you going on it reminds you 're going to terrible at the weather in ohio . and they 're going to feel you to the right decision hit .
it 's very difficult to clear about well-being of thinking , and i hope , i have them a sense of that , how hard it 's .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question you .
thank you .
now , when we have a few weeks ago phone 've mentioned , they told me to that 's a pretty interesting result , there , this one of <unk> poll was .
this is something , what they go to participate , let , because they now a few minutes left have ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think that most result , that we in the <unk> survey have found is a number , we absolutely not to expect .
we found that in the lucky , the <unk> itself .
if we looked at the emotions with the income <unk> .
and it turns , that under a income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a great a representative sample , under a income of over 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 years ago .
dk : 60,000 years ago .
60,000 dollars in the year are the people getting unhappy , and they are becoming increasingly less , the poorer , they 're going .
about that we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i 've ever so flat lines .
what happens , is obviously , money , no <unk> we , but that lack of money , certainly the misery we , and we can this misery , really clear to measure .
in terms of the other , the <unk> , you get another story .
ever more money you earned <unk> levels is you .
this is not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american an it 's going to live , freedom , the quest to happiness .
when people to them take seriously , you know , i mean , it 's all the head to ask , everything , what we think , for example , in terms of the <unk> and so forth .
there 's a chance that politicians that the country , generally a them as the take seriously , i would and that 's based on politics , would make it ?
dk : you know , i believe that 's an appreciation , there for the role of <unk> in the policy .
the recognition is slow to be in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , what they 're now , and in other countries that happens , they 're now .
the people are and , recognizing that you , very lucky to think should , if you , politics , thinking .
it 's a while it , and the people will discuss , if you <unk> to want or whether they <unk> to want , so we have to this discussion is pretty soon .
how you 're lucky , increase is it 's very differently depending on them , as you think and if you , that <unk> even think , or whether you , that <unk> even think .
this is politics are , i think in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you , , that <unk> the population to measure .
this is , i think in the next , or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this topic is , or should at least the most political debate , to be about the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i am , jane <unk> . i <unk> games .
i <unk> now for 10 years , online . and my goal for the next decade is , it was as easy to make the world in the reality to save , in <unk> to save .
i have a plan for it . i want more people to convince them , including you all , more time with the play a bigger and <unk> games to spend .
now we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a whole bunch of time for games . ''
maybe something to be much time , if you think about how many problems we desperately in the real world to have .
indeed , but , my research on the institute for the future that , is exactly the opposite <unk> .
three billion hours per week are n't even close enough to the most of the world to solve .
indeed , i am convinced that , if we the next century on this planet to want , we have this time to dramatically increase .
i 've calculated that the took time , 21 billion hours <unk> per week is .
that appears first maybe something <unk> , so again , i do it , so it that ca : if we have issues like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity want to solve , i believe we have to try to play online for one of 21 billion hours per week to the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture of quite right , why i believe that play , so critical for the survival of human species in the future . it seriously .
this is a her the photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings of the play catch . so , he 's going on the players , a camera up .
this is one of the classic of the play .
if you do n't any players are going to avoid them , maybe some of nuances in this picture .
you probably this sense for the urgency , something that fear , but also <unk> concentration , <unk> in the problems of a really tough problem .
if you also play , you see some of nuances . here , after the top <unk> eyes and the mouth that are a sign of the optimism . the brow and show surprise .
this is a player , the edge of so-called <unk> <unk> is .
oh , you know that . ok well . so we have some of the player .
a <unk> victory is a result , that very positive is that they did before i did n't know , it all possible .
it was almost go beyond the imagination .
and if you it , they 're shocked , they actually to something that are able to . this is a <unk> victory .
this player 's a moment ago , <unk> victory .
and this is it , what we on millions of their faces of <unk> the world 's see to , if we the hurdles , the next century in attacking . the face of those , as all odds on the edge of <unk> <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we see more like this face in real life , if we are difficult problems face .
i call it as the `` in life , i a bad . '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes , ok .
that i am , as i think that `` in life , i a bad . '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti and in my former home in berkeley , california , where i in my was studying why we in playing better are as in real life .
that 's a problem , that many of the players have .
we think that we in the reality is not that are good as in play .
and i 'm not only less to succeed , though that to be heard .
we reach in <unk> more . i mean , well in the connection with the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to working together .
if we in a <unk> are , i believe that many of us , in our best version of them into , anytime and immediately <unk> are , been the problem to try , so long as much needed , it after the <unk> again , try .
and in the reality , if we fail , if we have the obstacles and , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated , we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games , in play there 's what they simply not .
and that 's what i was a student at wanted .
why is it in play an impossible , to think , you could n't just all do ?
how we can these feelings of the play in the reality that ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , that the ideals that environment , collaborative solving it .
and i have some things that the epic <unk> in <unk> so possible .
so , first , if you in one of online 're going to , all the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of characters , are willing , you a <unk> mission <unk> , and it immediately .
but not just some mission , but a mission , perfectly to her current level in the game fit , right ?
so do you that .
they get never be a task , they do n't solve .
but always the edge of their skills , so to you better . but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you is not around and turns <unk> . it 's always very specific something important to do .
and there 's tons of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people , with them together to your very epic mission conclude .
that we have in real life , not so simple , this sense , at a <unk> tons of employees to stand .
and there 's this epic story , this inspiring story , why we there are and what we have to do .
then get we have this whole positive feedback .
they have determines , `` level up , '' and `` plus-one strength , '' heard or `` plus-one intelligence . ''
this constant , feedback , there 's not in real life .
if i do this stage to leave , i did n't , plus-one talk , and plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i get in real life that feedback .
so , the problem <unk> like the world of warcraft , is that 's so <unk> is , anytime , the edge of <unk> <unk> to stand , we 'd like our whole time in these <unk> spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
until today i 've all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years , so i spent the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
this is not necessarily something bad .
it might sound evil .
but to it 's time in context to see , ago <unk> million years , began our first <unk> up to go .
the first <unk> primate and so .
ok , so if we talk about it , how much time we 're now with play spend , does that just a sense , when you , the time in the scale of human development , eyes , holding the extraordinarily is .
but also be appropriate . because it turns , that we , by we all of this time to play using the fact that change , what we as people in the are able to .
we need to us to collaborative <unk> , very much beings .
this is the truth . that i believe .
at you once this interesting about statistics , recently from a researchers around the carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man of today in a country with strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . age .
so , 10,000 hours , is a very interesting number , from two reasons :
first again , for children in the united states are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> , you in the school to spend , of the five . grade to the end by the high school -- if you 've never been missing .
so we have here 's a complete <unk> , the young people just learning , what it , a good players to be like all other , what you in the school to learn .
and may have some of them the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' to read .
so you know of his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
they are based on the great research on the <unk> that , if we have 10,000 hours with the <unk> for one any subject to the 21st century . age of , we 're going to coming in it .
we 're so well , what 's also always work to the most people the world .
so , what we have here , is a complete generation of young people , the <unk> .
the big question is so , `` what exactly are the players are really good ? ''
because if we that out how could , we have sort of that never been there <unk> human potential to .
so many people we currently in the world , the least an hour a day with <unk> spend .
this are our <unk> . 500 million people , the extraordinary , well , `` something '' .
and the next decade we have a another billion players , the extraordinary , well , what 's also always .
if you it still do n't have heard ,
the <unk> developed <unk> , the energy to save and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , online can play .
you 're expecting an extra one billion player in the next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so i started , to think , what it is , at us these games to coming .
here are the four things , i found . when the first thing : <unk> .
ok , imagine if you like the extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is the desire , right to do something , a challenge to coming , together with the believe that we have a <unk> hope kept on success .
players who believe , that a <unk> victory is possible , and that it , worth , it to try , and it .
players 're not around .
players are masters in spiders a social nets .
there 's a lot more interesting research , to show that we people more like , after we do with you played have , even if you go to evil defeated .
the reason for this is that 's a lot of trust it requires , with someone a game to play .
we trust that someone time with us to spend the rules <unk> be that we same goal , and to <unk> and stay .
so to the <unk> that grow out of ties , trust and each other .
as a result of building we are stronger the social relations .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason , why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week , plays , sort of as <unk> .
the reason is that , if we play , we 're actually be happier and , hard to work , as if we relax , or doing nothing .
we know that we as human beings , optimal , work , if we make hard , significant to do .
and the players are always ready , hard to work , if you the right to get .
and ultimately , very epic , meaning .
players love it , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> <unk> .
here 's a <unk> to that the right light to go back . you know it determines , wikipedia , the <unk> the world .
the largest <unk> the world , almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft the <unk> than about any other issue in each other <unk> the world .
they create a very epic story .
they create a very epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , that are so four superpowers , to a single outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it are people , believe that you as a single change the world .
and the only problem is that they believe , you can the virtual worlds to change , but not the real .
this is the problem , that i 'm going to try .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he looked at , why people so much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to witnesses , not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> . ''
and that of a economist . so he 's logical .
and he says ...
not so how i -- i <unk> games , i 'm doing something <unk> .
so he says , that makes actually make sense , because the player can in <unk> more to as in real life .
you can in play a stronger the social ties each other than in real life . they get more feedback and the rewards in play as in real life .
so , he says , it 's currently , totally logical that players are more time in the virtual world as in the real spend .
i voice first time to , that 's logical .
but it 's definitely no <unk> .
we need to start , the real world in a game to transform .
my main inspiration comes from a event , the 2,500 years <unk> .
there 's these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
, these fantastic <unk> there 's <unk> .
and that were sort of the first of people were <unk> .
and if you with the <unk> the old greek <unk> <unk> 're familiar , you know , maybe this story . the story about , and why games have invented .
according <unk> were playing games , more <unk> , in the animal kingdom <unk> during a famine .
supposedly , there 's such a great famine , the king of <unk> , to a crazy idea that i decided that .
the people <unk> . the people were .
it was a sort of the situation . you took a sort of the solution .
so they do you , according <unk> , that <unk> and agreed to a national strategy . , a day would you eat . the next day you would play .
and they were so , in the <unk> <unk> be , games , so fascinating that are and us with <unk> , <unk> productivity with you to forget it would be that 's nothing to eat , there .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> survive , like 18 years for these famine , by showing you , a day , eating and the playing .
as well , i think , put them today we 'll play a .
we put play a to the suffering from the real world to escape .
we put play a to all due to avoid that in the real world 's not work , everything that in real life , not <unk> is , and we bring us what we need from the play .
but that does n't have to the end to be .
that 's exciting .
according <unk> was , 18 years , the famine , not better . so i decided to the king , a last <unk> <unk> .
they did the kingdom , in two halves .
they were a <unk> and the winner got to a <unk> adventure , it .

that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> , later that <unk> rich <unk> , the same dna as the old <unk> have .
so i came to scientists recently to an attitude , <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and we geologists found evidence is a global cooling , almost 20 years took what the famine , to be .
so i could take these crazy story to vote .
you might have actually , people through play rescued , by , you have 18 years for in games <unk> have and then this <unk> , and so much about this one another play learned , by the whole civilization have saved .
so , that we can also .
we 're playing since 1994 warcraft .
that was the first <unk> in the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they were 18 years for <unk> , we play for 16 years of warcraft .
i , we 're ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent the half of civilization , the looking after a new world . so i mean , 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should look at <unk> the half of us an hour a day with play spend , until we the problems of the real world have solved .
i know , they 're going to say , `` how to solve , we are the real world in play ? '' and exactly this question i mean work in the last few years , the institute for the future devoted to .
we have this banner , in our office in palo alto , it <unk> of how we the future to be .
we do n't want to try to the future , before to say .
what we want , is the future to create .
we want to the best result , imagine . and then people to <unk> , this idea in the reality to .
we ask us that epic <unk> , and give people the ways that you to achieve .
i 'll show you very short , three games , i designed to have to try to people that epic <unk> in their own future to give them .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
this game is of 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , in the you a <unk> get to .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> to make it for them , realistic , and they her real life in fact , without oil life . so , if you to play <unk> , they tell us , where they live . and then get you <unk> in real , to show you how much oil costs , what 's not there , like food with this is how to transport , with going to school closed are , whether it uprisings , there . and you to figure out how they her real life make , if it 's true , it . and we ask you , about to blog , videos or the photos to .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and tested . and we have you ever since the last three years with .
and i can tell you , it was a changing the experience .
nobody wants to be life change , because it 's good for the environment is , or because we do it should .
but if you in a <unk> adventures are and told you get , `` of us about the oil . ''
this is a fascinating about adventure , on that you about .
they find out , survive , you . the most of the players have the game <unk> habits , we could .
so we for the next <unk> play a bigger , higher goal into than just <unk> .
we have the game , `` <unk> '' the institute for the future .
starting point is the calculation of <unk> the people just , 23 years on the planet are left .
of supercomputers called `` global <unk> <unk> '' , of course .
the call , players , sign , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> designed .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it that , `` <unk> '' there . they have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and just put together , they can the world to save .
but in our own game , instead of the only five people , we say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 players have played the game , eight weeks for .
they found the 500 incredibly creative solutions , you read , if you , `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game , we look at 3 . march out . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you the game so , get you of the world bank , the distinction , `` social <unk> '' the end by 2010 .
we work with the universities in , sub-saharan africa and they invite a , social <unk> to learn .
we have a comic . we have `` level up , '' for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and his ingenuity .
i want you all invite , this game with young people to share , around the world , , especially in <unk> , of benefits , and their own social enterprises imagine the world to save .
i am now , the end .
i want you something interesting questions .
what , you think that happens when the next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games , the show us , we can do , but we have the real world still not be saved .
well , i hope that they told me at agree that players , human resources are , we need to work in real life can use , and that play a big meaning for change .
we 've all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability , where social them to knit , <unk> and the desire to <unk> meaning .
i 'm really , we put together a significant play games to on this planet , another century to survive .
and i hope , they 're going with me that play a design and play .
if i 'm going into the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things that 's safe , that we have any <unk> future can make , and that we all kinds of play games .
so i say , let 's the <unk> games to start !
thanks .
i would you 'd like something about what to me a few months ago , writing one article for <unk> wired , notice is .
i have to write , my <unk> our , but i was , edit the <unk> already done , and i fell on that i still never in my life <unk> have what the word `` the disabled , '' really means .
i read them the post .
`` the disabled , '' <unk> , `` <unk> , helpless , useless , destroyed , <unk> , thousands , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , paralyzed , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , from the traffic moved , <unk> , done , broken <unk> , <unk> , lo and also get hurt , useless , and weak .
<unk> , healthy , strong , <unk> . ''
i have this list of a friend , according to read and i had first of laughter , it seemed so ridiculous , but i was just to `` <unk> '' and i could n't even more <unk> , and had to stop to read and i first of the after this <unk> <unk> and the order to <unk> emotional shock .
of course was that a <unk> , an <unk> . i told me just thought that the copy , pretty old to be .
but actually it was a copy the early '80s , when i just with the primary school when i started and so i started , my self just outside of my family with build and to form , also in terms of the other children and the rest of the world to me around .
and god was very much i was no <unk> .
i would this post take seriously , would i in a world was born , somebody like me as a person to perceive that would , whose lives in <unk> in a lost . today , but i 'm going for the opportunity and adventure , i experienced have , celebrated .
so i immediately the <unk> of 2009 navigated and expect , here 's a <unk> contribution to find .
here 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
<unk> , it 's not much better .
especially <unk> me the last two words , `` near <unk> '' `` well , '' and `` eat healthy . ''
but it 's not only to the words .
it 's about , what we about the people think , we do with these words of .
it 's the values , in these words stuck , and how we these values build .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world and the people to move around us .
many <unk> societies , including the the greeks , and the roman , have really believed that the <unk> one <unk> a great force , because that , what you to <unk> , also <unk> can .
so , what we want to actually <unk> -- a <unk> people or a powerful people ?
just been a people <unk> as a child to call , could be enough , they <unk> and you ideas <unk> .
it would n't beautiful , you the doors to open up ?
a person , for me the doors has opened , was my pediatrician in the <unk> . dupont institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he is dr. <unk> . a <unk> , of his name , as you think , the most americans are not accurate just could . so he was always , dr. p. called .
and dr. p. was always very colorful , flying and was for the work with kids as simple .
i found the time , i in this hospital , i spent have , just great -- until on my <unk> .
i had one will seem to be forever , again with these fat , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know , to my <unk> build . and i have this <unk> more hated worse than all other . i did they hated it . i they are bleeding tumor . i did they hated it .
and ask you ago , i actually , as <unk> child with dr. p. negotiate and so i tried to this will to stop , <unk> no success .
and one day , he told me , of my favorite exercises at -- this will were just tiring and mercilessly , and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> , you 're going like a strong , <unk> and young girl , you 're going to one day one of <unk> <unk> .
and if you do it can , i tell you a hundred dollars . ''
that was one of course , just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i the will do , i do n't want to , with the prospect , the richest five-year-old girl in the ward in the floor . but he has to me in fact that brought them , my daily <unk> with new eyes . so , it 's a new and <unk> experience .
and i ask me today , like , his vision of me as strong and <unk> young girl , my self shaped , and i 'm so imagine it was able to me as a lot of nature of strong , powerful and <unk> person .
that 's just an example of you , as adults in <unk> the imagination of a child <unk> .
but the way , <unk> examples of the <unk> prove that makes us our language is no room , something to imagine , what we all want you know , it every single to , , as powerful people to see .
our language <unk> the societal change , afterwards , in many cases , through a technological change was .
the medical point of looking at you can kind of course , say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titan , artificial <unk> for an aging body , it to allow people , really all their opportunities to use and , about the borders , you her natural destiny , put it has to figure out to develop , not to speak of social <unk> platforms , people to , a own identity to give , on their own way , and the way that , and , with the world , to groups with , you , pick .
maybe it shows so this technological change , more , because we 've ever , it always been a different truth , there , which is that every man of society something very <unk> and very <unk> can give and that the human ability , adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt to -- that 's an interesting story , because people to me again and that 's ask them to tell , as i do with the odds deal and i 'm going to you something to confess , that sentence , for me , never <unk> and i always very uncomfortable with it felt the questions of people to answer , and i think , gradually i , why .
this phrase from -- with the odds that lives of the idea that success or happiness of it depends on , a challenge to coming , without the so on the experience by . as if my life so successful go to be , because i the kinds of falling of life with a prosthetic limb of could , like , always people to me with my disability perceive .
but the truth is that we change . course , we are the challenge , by the matter whether you physically , emotional , or even the two is
and what i 'm going to this is good .
odds are not an obstacle that we <unk> to be able to deal with our lives better clear to come .
odds are just to our lives .
and i tend to the odds , when my shadow .
sometimes you realize that i do that he 's very mind is , sometimes he is n't wait to see , but he 's constantly at me .
and i want to not the impact or . the heavy , the <unk> of people <unk> .
there 's in life odds and challenges , and the 're just <unk> real and each person 's going to be different . but the question is not , whether we do with the odds be clear , or not , but how we 're going to clear to come .
so we 're not just responsible for the people , we love , ago <unk> to keep them , but they also to prepare , well , so clear to come .
and we need to be our children have fallen , if we put them that sense to give you to , not to adapt .
you have to two things that separate , , the medical fact , an to be , and the other the social think about , if i as i 'm or not .
and to be honest , the only real and persistent disability , with the i apart , sit there had is that the time , says , you can see me with this definition of .
in our desire , the people to protect the us the heart of and you the cold , hard to the truth about their medical prediction to or even a prognosis of the quality to ask , they expected , we have to pay attention , we 're not the really to put that somebody actually being disabled .
maybe is that we concept , the only to attention , in a broken , is , and how we that to fix , for every single a greater disability than the pathology , .
if we have a people do n't <unk> treat , and not all its forces and opportunities to perceive and to acknowledge , do we in addition to the natural struggle , you may lead to , one another disease .
we <unk> a people , for our society is a value .
so we have to the <unk> out to look and us on all the area of the human possibilities to focus .
the most important , but is that 's between the perception of our <unk> and our of ingenuity , a connection there .
we should , challenging times , not <unk> or in denial , we should n't try , you to avoid , we should they 're under the carpet return , but it 's about , in the odds opportunity to recognize .
it 's me , perhaps more about , clear to imagine that we odds are not get to , but that we need to open , are , you to hug , the seize to put to also time a <unk> to use and maybe even to dance .
and maybe do we make it , the odds , as something natural , coherent and useful to see , and feel about us , by their presence n't even more than that had .
in this year and celebration , the 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he was 150 years ago about evolution has written , darwin , in my eyes , on something very true in the human character , pointed out .
i would it 's so what , not the most of its way to survive , and also not the <unk> its way , but the , the , changes the adapt .
of conflicts of creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the ability of people , to survive and <unk> , the battle of human spirit determines is , by conflict to go into .
so , again , change and adapt these are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we know , first , out of wood , we <unk> are , if we really through .
that 's exactly that the sense of the odds , a perception of <unk> , a feeling for our own power .
we can be so even something to .
we can odds be a new meaning to give the very different times beyond .
maybe we odds , as a change .
odds are for a change , the we still do n't have adapted .
i think , the biggest of damage , we even <unk> have , is to believe that we 're normal should be .
times more honest , who is normal ?
there 's not normal .
there 's the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and you to this poor , the gray person 's really know , and learn to , if it they really there ?
i think , rather , not .
it would be great , if we have this paradigm of normality , a different kind of options , or the strength to it even still a little bit dangerous to those , this could . so we can the forces of very many kids to release , and you to invite , their very particular , and valued skills in the society in .
<unk> 've got out found that we people from the members of our society , one <unk> have , useful to be , and a contribution to afford .
there 's evidence that , the neanderthals , 60,000 years older people and people with of physical injuries , by have and this was perhaps , because the life in <unk> of people for the society value was ,
they have these people not as a broken and useless at ; they were as something special , and those treated .
a few years ago , i went on the city , in the time i grew up was , in a <unk> in the `` the red zone . '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there , a <unk> tomatoes .
it was the summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear , as a guy behind me , says , `` well , if that 's not <unk> <unk> is . ''
and i turn to me , and i see these elders man . i had no idea who he 's .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , we know us ? and i ca n't , you . ''
and he said , `` well , they <unk> , barely , i remember .
when i do you the first time i saw , i do you from the belly of her mother got . ''
oh , so the .
and of course , it , but then they click .
that was dr. <unk> , a man , i just from multiple narratives of my mother about this day i knew , because i course , very typical , to my birthday , two weeks to it came .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mother was in the vacation , and so i knew my parents the man , the me to the world 's got to do n't .
and because i do without <unk> was born , and my feet , after them for , and i just a few toes , this and a few toes in the other foot , he was the <unk> , of strangers to the bad news <unk> .
he said to me , `` i had to your parents say that you 've never walk , would , and never been so <unk> be would like the other children or that you never a <unk> life to could , and since they 've got me simply lying <unk> . ''
really extraordinary , i found that he 's <unk> my entire childhood , now , whatever , if i at a <unk> in the second grade , won had , if i do with the <unk> the parade , <unk> way was , whatever , if i my fellowship , or of my <unk> <unk> <unk> had , and he was using these clips to his students to teach , <unk> of the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x amount of the potential of human being willing .
you can just not enough to emphasize , how critical of a factor for the quality of people can be .
and dr. <unk> she goes on , he said , `` i learned that children , if you do n't always something else said , i get , and also if you just a little support to get , if you have children , <unk> , you can teach kids are very much . ''
you see , dr. <unk> has to be thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone to deal , two different things are .
and also , i 've got my thinking in over the time has changed , if you to me the age of 15 years , i asked to have , if i mean who against the legs of meat and bone <unk> have , i would have no one second <unk> .
i was necessarily have normal work .
if you to me that today to ask , i 'm not so sure .
and that 's happening , because i do something with my legs , i have and not yet despite these experiences .
and perhaps could this change is also happen , because i so many people we 're 'm going to the me the doors , open , have , instead of people to face , i cut , or me a little idea on wanted .
you see , it really , people , you demos , their forces <unk> , and they 're going through .
if you it to enable , his own , inside of forces to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do , and for anyone in a critical moment a door up , then they 're for these people a very good teachers .
they bring them at the , the doors to open .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means , something to produce , in this is the potential <unk> .
again , which the potential to we , access ?
in the '60s years was in a <unk> done . then were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` <unk> <unk> '' in the we call this as `` <unk> . ''
the students going to music it .
and the a student will <unk> harder through , the better teacher <unk> .
they have then about a <unk> period of students with a `` enough , '' the top grade , `` very well , '' gave them . it was them , they were <unk> , very clever would . and after these three months have you really <unk> written .
and of course <unk> it , the heart to hear that way around the <unk> was told , they were just enough .
and as it was then after the three months , too .
but only those , still in the school were , besides the students , the school <unk> had .
very crucial in this study that was the teachers wo n't <unk> were .
the teachers are n't know that something changed .
you i was just told me to be the student and that are the students with the note enough . and as you have you something teaching and they 're treated .
the only real disability is a broken mind is a spirit , the broken , has no hope . he find nothing more beautiful . he 's our natural , one curiosity . and our innate capacity of <unk> .
if we do it , but creating the human spirit and to support to continue to hope , , and other people to , around beautiful to find , curious , and <unk> to be then put we forces that really positive .
if a mind about these qualities that , we can be a new reality , and new <unk> do .
i want with a poem end , this one of a persian poet named <unk> in 14 . century , wrote , and of the me my friend , jacques <unk> told . and the poem called `` the god , the only four words know . '' `` every child knows , not the god , the name , not the god , the <unk> , but the god , the only four words to know , and these are repeated , he says , only : come to dance with me . ''
come to dance with me .
