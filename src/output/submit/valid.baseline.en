you know , one of the big <unk> the travel and a kind of that the <unk> research is , together with the people to live , the , still , the old days to remind you can . the your past was still in the wind to feel , you on the rain <unk> rocks and touch , in the bitter leaves the plants and taste .
just that you know that <unk> still go beyond the milky way to travel , or the importance of myths , the oldest of <unk> , full of these are , that in the himalayas , the buddhists still the breath of <unk> track , which means , the central epiphany of anthropology , into memory to shout out , that 's the idea that the world , in the we live , not in a total of that exists , but just as a model of reality , as a consequence of a group of certain ways of an adaptation , we know , <unk> succeed , , many generations of chose .
and of course , sharing , we all the same <unk> .
we 're all born . we get kids to the world .
we 're going through <unk> .
we need to deal with the <unk> separation of the death is going and so it should we 're not surprise that we all the singing , dancing and and art to produce .
but it 's interesting is the unique vocal cadence of <unk> , the flow of the dance in every culture .
and plays it does n't matter , whether it , the <unk> in the forests of borneo , is , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior , <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> in the sahara . this is to the colleague , , i a month ago in the desert , traveled 'm . or even a <unk> , the on the <unk> , everest , the <unk> the world .
all these people teach us that 's still the other <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways to the orientation in the earth there .
and that 's a little idea , the , if you think about , a with just hope to meet .
together and the <unk> cultures , the world a net of <unk> and cultural life , that the earth at and for that probably the earth as important is , like that biological <unk> , that you as the biosphere know .
you can , this cultural <unk> as a <unk> imagine . <unk> can and as the sum of thoughts and dreams , myths and ideas , inspirations -- and <unk> , of the human imagination ever since the beginnings of consciousness , by were , defined .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
they did this symbol of all of , what we 're and what we as an amazing <unk> species are able to .
and just like the biosphere , and away , in this with the <unk> -- only with , greater the speed .
not a biologist would an example , dare to suggest that 50 percent or more of all species in short years ago , the extinction are , there 's just not true . and yet , this -- that <unk> <unk> the area of biological diversity -- which is barely the , what makes us as <unk> <unk> the area of cultural diversity , is .
and the key indicator of this is the extinction of languages .
as each of them in this room was born , were on the earth 6,000 talking about .
now is a language not just the of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is an expression of human spirit .
you is a means , with the soul of a culture has access to the material world find .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a point , a thought , an ecosystem spiritual and opportunities .
and of these 6,000 different languages are today , as we 're here in monterey sit , the half not more in the ears of children <unk> .
they 're going <unk> n't even more taught . that means , if nothing done is , they 're actually already be dead .
what could be lonely be , as the silence at to be one of the last couple of your people to be , your language to talk , no way to have the wisdom of the ancestors <unk> , or the hope that children to expect me ?
and yet <unk> this terrible of fact , somebody somewhere on the earth , about . all the two weeks , because of two weeks , dies a older , man and take the last <unk> an old language with , the tomb .
and i know that some of you say , it 's not better than that ? '' would be the world 's not a better place , if we all just a language to be ? '' and i say , '' well , let this language , yoruba . let you <unk> be .
let you kogi . ''
and then they would suddenly realize , how it , if you get their own language ca n't talk to be .
so i want you today a way , on a journey through the <unk> take them , a short journey through the <unk> to try to them understandable to do , what actually been lost .
now there 's some of us , the way , forget that i , when i say `` different ways of being , '' really different ways of being mean .
take you for this child , <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , that people , the <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from east , from the belly of sacred , snakes <unk> .
this is a people , which is not being cognitively between the colors , blue and green is different , that <unk> the forest , of the people depend , <unk> is .
they have a to language and a <unk> the linguistic <unk> is called , you have to anyone get married , a different language , talks .
all this is rooted in the mythological past . that to , this big houses , in which one of the <unk> six or seven languages , talked to be , is , however , you never , who hear , a language is learning .
you 're just to and start , then to talk .
or , one of the <unk> tribes , which i ever lived have the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first time in the year in 1958 peaceful contacted .
in the year 1957 , trying to five <unk> to record and made a <unk> mistakes .
they threw <unk> photographs of , from the air down , what we as kind gesture them would . and <unk> you that these people from the rainforest in your life , never be something <unk> seen .
they raised these photographs from floor , on , trying behind the face or the figure out to see , we found nothing , and <unk> that this business of the devil be and killing the five <unk> with the spear .
but the <unk> killing not just <unk> with the spear .
they <unk> , each other .
54 percent of deaths were caused by <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations go back and found two million cases of natural death and when we the people with <unk> something about <unk> , they to that one of the people that old become was that he 's because of his age she died , and we 're killing him still with the spear .
but the same time they had a clear <unk> the forest , the amazing .
their hunters who were the urine of an animal of 40 steps at smell and determine , to which species , this was .
in the early <unk> years , i got a really amazing job , when i was my professor in the harvard and she said , if i that interested in it , haiti , to go and the secret societies have to infiltrate the the foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the venom , that for it was used to <unk> to do , sure .
to this <unk> a sense to give i had to say , something about this remarkable in the <unk> know , and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
in the opposite , it 's , a complex <unk> world .
it 's interesting .
if i do you would , the great world <unk> , what they would say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> or what 's also always .
a continent will always leave out , because the <unk> was , it in sub-saharan africa not religious people believe me give them . course there 's a and <unk> just is that <unk> this very <unk> religious thought , during the tragic diaspora to the <unk> <unk> .
but what <unk> so interesting power , is these are living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living give birth the spirits .
the minds can go from under the big water <unk> going to the answers on the flow of the dance , the soul of living temporarily to figure out , so that the <unk> for a shiny moment , god will .
<unk> say the <unk> like , `` you white is in the church and you about god .
we dancing in the temples , and i 'm going to god . ''
and because you 're obsessed with you , you going to the mind <unk> . how can you damage <unk> be ?
you see these amazing demonstrations , <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> coal , burning <unk> , an amazing graph the ability of mind the body , to influence , that it <unk> , if he was in a state of extremes arousal , put it .
now , of all people , i met you have , were the kogi of the sierra nevada and de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most .
around the old <unk> civilization , the <unk> plain of colombia world and in a result of conquest , i moved , this people in a <unk> <unk> can go back , that over the <unk> plain there .
in a <unk> continent , were these people the only , never of the <unk> conquered .
to today 's day , you going from a ritual priesthood governed , the training to that priesthood , is , very extraordinary .
the young <unk> be the age of three and four years of their families separated and in a <unk> world of <unk> , in <unk> the <unk> the glacier , for 18 years really . two periods of each nine years , you 're elected in the nine months of pregnancy imitate the you in your lap , their <unk> mother who were to spend , well <unk> in your lap , the great mother .
and during this whole time , you going to a cultural belief in the value of society introduced . values , the claim that , your prayers -- and just your prayers of the cosmic -- or we could say that environmental -- an equilibrium that .
the end of the amazing <unk> you going to one day , suddenly , out taken and the first time in your life , the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this <unk> moment of consciousness of the first light , if the sun , starts to the <unk> the amazing , beautiful landscape , are going to suddenly everything , what you in abstract 've learned in an amazing <unk> confirmed . and the priest kick them back and says , `` you see ? it 's really , as i do you telling .
it 's so wonderful . you have it to protect them . ''
they call , the older , brothers and say that we , we the younger , brothers are , for the destruction of the world in charge .
now this level of intuition is very important .
and if we , <unk> and the landscape , think , <unk> we 're either <unk> and the old lady who the fancy wild , up , which in his simplification of a <unk> idea is , or other thoreau and say , these people are more with the nature is connected , when we .
so , <unk> are n't sentimental , you will of nostalgia <unk> .
it is not a place for the <unk> swamps , <unk> or the cold <unk> from tibet , they have , though yet , through time and the ritual a mysterious <unk> the shaped , not the idea is based , you consciously , close to be , but on a far <unk> intuition , the idea that the earth , only exist can , because they 're in the human consciousness <unk> will .
now , what it mean ?
it means that a little kid from the andes , that in the think up the mountain in a <unk> is , be or her destiny to determine , is a very other person will , and a different relationship to this resource , or this place have , as a little kid from montana , that in the think up , a mountain in a bunch of stone is , the away can be .
if he 's a <unk> of mind , or a bunch <unk> is , is irrelevant .
the interesting is the metaphor , which the relationship between the individual and the nature is defined .
i grew up in the forests of british colombia , and i believed that these forests that there are , <unk> .
that made me to a other people as my friends , under the <unk> , believe that these forests of <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> minds are , the <unk> the world to live , the spirits , you , their <unk> participate , you .
now , if you start , the idea to look at that these cultures are different realities create , you can create some of their extraordinary discoveries to understand . like . this plant here .
it 's a picture , that i just last april , in the northwest of the amazon , on .
this is <unk> , of a lot of you 've heard , the most <unk> <unk> of the repertoire of <unk> .
what <unk> so fascinating about power , is not only that <unk> potential of this <unk> , but of processing . it 's really from two different sources that . the a side , there 's these wooden <unk> , a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , easy <unk> , <unk> . this <unk> just taking it 's about so as if , a blue <unk> smoke , on their minds put , it will , with the leaves of <unk> of the family , the <unk> with the name <unk> <unk> up .
this plant it contains some very strong <unk> the of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar .
if you , even the <unk> have seen , this stuff <unk> , this substance , you from different ways to make it contains that also <unk> .
this <unk> to <unk> is about like from a <unk> <unk> to be , <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it 's no distortion of reality is , but the resolution of reality .
i even with my professor , richard <unk> <unk> , the man , the <unk> <unk> with the discovery of the magic fungi in mexico in the <unk> years <unk> , about , discussing . i said , you this <unk> not as <unk> categorize it could , in the moment in the you the implications of feel , you do n't even more there is to a <unk> to learn .
but the thing with <unk> is the you to do n't <unk> <unk> can be , you through a in the human gut , <unk> enzyme , with names <unk> , <unk> be .
you can only in the connection with some other chemicals <unk> <unk> be the mao <unk> .
now this fascinating is that the <unk> , in the <unk> that are , <unk> of exactly the way that are the need is the <unk> to <unk> . you ask , so itself .
how can these people from a <unk> of over 80,000 species <unk> plants , these two , morphologically just not related plants and find the , if on this way you combine , a kind of <unk> version of creating , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts is ?
we use these great euphemism , trial and mistakes , what , as being meaningless turns out .
but we ask you the native americans tell you , `` the plant , talks to us . ''
so , what it mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have the 17th varieties , <unk> , they all the great distance in the forest see , for our eyes as a kind appear .
and then ask you , their <unk> <unk> and they say , i thought , you understand something of plants .
i mean , you know , does nothing ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns , that you any of 17 varieties , <unk> <unk> and they sing to a in a different <unk> .
so , that brings them not a ph.d. in the harvard , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> to count .
so , that <unk> the problem is that even those of us , and sympathy for the hard to the native have , as <unk> and colorful look , but somehow the past to , during the world , which our world , <unk> .
so , the fact is that you , , that 20 . century , in 300 years , not for his wars or technological innovation , remember is , but rather than , an era , in the we <unk> , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity around the earth , either an active , supported , or a passive <unk> . so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have , again , the dance with new <unk> involved .
and the problem is not the technology , .
the <unk> were not less on the sioux to be , when you must bow and the arrow of tasks , as the americans who stopped americans to be , when you a horse and <unk> tasks .
ca n't change and technology could threaten the integrity of <unk> . it 's power . that ugly face the of .
and where we also , you , in the world <unk> , you will discover that these cultures , not the of the <unk> . this are extremely dynamic , living people , whose existence through <unk> forces , by going to the about their capacity , and beyond . whether it , and the <unk> logging in the country , <unk> is , a <unk> from asia , of <unk> , a people , that , one generation freely in the forest , living , and now to <unk> and prostitution , the river <unk> , from where you can see , even the river with the mud , polluted is , nearly half borneo , in the <unk> sea <unk> seems . of where the japanese <unk> the horizon , to see are , are willing to their <unk> with the raw <unk> to fill the you the forest away . or how the case of <unk> , where it <unk> are , during the <unk> <unk> .
or if we in the mountains of tibet and go , where i <unk> much on , you that ugly face the political and dominance .
you know , the genocide that <unk> extinction of people 's general , convicted , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lifestyle , the people , will not just not be convicted , but generally , and <unk> as part of <unk> celebrated .
and you can that suffering <unk> n't understand , if you do n't it on <unk> level to have .
i went even with a young colleagues 6,000 of miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> by <unk> after <unk> and just as i , <unk> came , i saw the face , behind the statistics of which you hear . 6,000 holy monuments , in the rubble , and ash into . 1.2 million people , during the cultural revolution of the <unk> killed .

that meant that he 's during the chinese invasion immediately killed .
his uncle bug living with their sanctity in the diaspora , the people , nepal .
his mother was locked up , as much punishment , for -- for the crime , wealthy .
he was the age of two years in the prison smuggled to , under your <unk> to hide , they do without it 's not life could .
the sister , these <unk> did <unk> , in a <unk> brought them .
one day , stepped you out of on a armband <unk> and for these <unk> had to you for seven years in a heavy camp .
that suffering <unk> can unbearably be , but the <unk> spirit of people 's something <unk> .
and the end , we are really , a choice . we would like to in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity of life ?
margaret <unk> , the big anthropologist who said before they died , it their greatest fear is , as we in towards a thread , <unk> , <unk> world move , we 're not just the whole range of human imagination , on a <unk> way down to see it would , but that we one day from a dream up , and i 've forgotten , it ever other options there .
and it 's really humbling to that to think that our species , maybe for over 600,000 years longer exists .
the <unk> revolution , the us the agriculture got , and us in this moment the cult of <unk> <unk> , the poetry , the <unk> through the prose the priesthood <unk> and hierarchy , specialization of the surplus , created -- i found , just 10,000 years , instead .
the modern industrial world as we do you know is n't wait for 300 years old .
now , these <unk> history tells me not that we all the answers on the challenges have , which we in the next for millennia to stand .
if we these <unk> <unk> after the importance of being human questions , the answers you with 10,000 various voices .
and in this song we 're going to the way <unk> , that to be , what we are , people with <unk> consciousness , the , the importance of these are , all people and gardens , a space to flourish , can <unk> going to . and there 's great moments of the optimism .
here is a picture , that i the northern the <unk> on , when i do with <unk> on the <unk> went . and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his <unk> .
the canadian government is not always very well with the <unk> others and during the <unk> years in <unk> the <unk> our of , they were forced me , settlements , to .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family , the fear to be life was , took him , guns and all the tools .
now to you know that the <unk> not afraid , the cold . they used to you to their advantage .
the <unk> their <unk> , originally from fish , in <unk> wrapped , it .
the grandfather of the man <unk> , not going on the arctic night , or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> to find out , and his pants down from <unk> down and <unk> in his hand . and as the feces to <unk> started , shaped , he you in the form of <unk> .
he <unk> saliva , on the sides of <unk> and when it completely frozen was , <unk> he 's a dog with it .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a <unk> , took this skeleton of the dog and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> a other dog , and <unk> about the <unk> with the <unk> the belt .
so you can kind of nothing to make something .
and this is on many ways a symbol for the resistance of <unk> and all indigenous the world .
the canadian government was the <unk> in april 1999 , the complete control over a field , the greater is , california , texas .
it 's our new home country , and i mean <unk> .
it 's a <unk> area . they control all <unk> .
a an example , as a nation , a state , and atonement with his people go and achieve .
and ultimately , i believe it 's pretty obvious , at least for those of us , to these distant for the earth , traveled are , to realize that they do n't get away .
they are the <unk> of someone .
they represent the parts of human imagination , in the past the back . and for all of us to be the dreams of those kids , like the dreams of our own children of the geography of hope .
what we look at national geographic ultimately to try , is that we believe that politicians ever done something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> not a pervasive this is , but we believe that storytelling , the world can change and so we 're probably the best of the institution for storytelling in the world . our website , you get 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations to send our tv .
we make magazines , of millions of reading .
and we company 's a series of travel in the <unk> , on which we our audience to places of such cultural and wonder take you to the <unk> <unk> be . and hopefully , you going to one after the other the central epiphany of anthropology assume , that this world 's made , on different ways to exist , we have a <unk> in a really multicultural <unk> world can find , at the wisdom of all people to our shared well-being can contribute .
thank you .
what i do you first , so fast as possible , i 'll show , is the fundamental work , a new technology , we microsoft , as part of <unk> ago exactly a year , to have . this is <unk> . and it 's an environment , in the you either local or take away with huge amounts of visual data to deal .
we see many , a lot of gigabytes , digital photographs here , you will seamlessly , and constantly <unk> , <unk> , on any way the new arrangements .
and it 's no matter , how many of information we look at the size of this huge collections that are or how big the images .
the most of you 're digital photos of a camera , but this is here for a scan of congress and it 's in an area of 300 <unk> .
it does n't matter , because the only what the performance of the system like this be can , is the number , <unk> on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible , architecture .
this is a whole book , for <unk> .
this is <unk> house of <unk> . every <unk> is a chapter .
to prove that it really to a text and not to a picture is , we do something like that do to really to show that these a real representation of <unk> and not a picture is .
maybe this is an artificial way , a <unk> to read .
i would it does n't recommend .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of <unk> .
and that there you really the delight and the good experience a real <unk> a magazine or a newspaper to read , what , a kind of the medium with several of magnitude .
we also something , the corner of this particular copy of the guardian did .
we have a false this with very high , which designed , much higher than at a normal this is , and we have extra content , added .
if you the functions , cars look like , you see here .
or different models , or even a technical <unk> .
and this , and really these ideas on , these constraints , for the available to place on the screen <unk> .
we hope that no pop-ups and other nonsense , which means -- that should n't need to be .
now , is that mapping , the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i want to here 's really not much time to spend , except to say that we also to this area that will .
but this are all roads in the united states .
<unk> up on the <unk> picture of the nasa .
you make us now something else out .
this is now , even live in the internet . you can it <unk> .
this is a project with the name <unk> , that really two different technologies together .
the a is <unk> and the other is a very good science about <unk> , of noah <unk> , a <unk> the university of washington , under the advice from steve <unk> , the <unk>
and rick <unk> of microsoft research , did was . a very good working together .
so this is live in the internet . it will of <unk> by .
you can see that , if we do this kind of views , in which we by images and penetrate , and this experience the <unk> , which do .
but the spatial as the images here is in the fact of meaning .
the <unk> have these pictures together that so you the real space , in the these images , all the near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian rockies were made that correspond to . you see here elements of <unk> slides , or <unk> <unk> and these things were all in the relationship with each other , put it .
i do n't know , if i still time you have you very different environments to show .
there 's what , much <unk> .
i 'd like right , the original <unk> of noah show and this is from a early prototype of <unk> , the we first time in summer 've been working to them that to show , what i believe that 's really the same punchline behind this technology , the <unk> is . and this is not so obviously , if you the environments at the we the site .
we had to us , because of the lawyers <unk> . worry .
this is a <unk> the cathedral <unk> lady , the only in the computer with images from flickr <unk> . give you just <unk> lady in the flickr , and they are pictures of men in t-shirts and the <unk> <unk> . get . each of orange <unk> represents a picture , that as to this model <unk> was discovered .
so they 're doing this is all <unk> , and they all stand in on this way in the relationship with each other .
and we can on this very simple way to navigate .
. you know , i 've never believed that i ended up at microsoft 're going .
i 'm very grateful for the <unk> here .
. i suspect , you can see that this many different kinds of cameras are , everything is , and , of the <unk> to professional <unk> , a pretty large number of them , all in this environment <unk> .
and when possible , i 'm going to some of weird to find .
a lot of you 're of their faces covered <unk> .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here are you .
this is actually a poster of <unk> lady , the right recorded was .
we can of the poster to a physical view this environment to change .
the point is here , we do things with the social environment , do . it will now data from all gathered around -- of the entire collective memory of the way , visually kind of the earth that looks -- and everything is connected to each other .
all these photographs are connected to each and it is something that the greater is as the sum of the parts .
they get a model , that from all over the earth is .
at you this as the sequel of work of stephen <unk> , virtual earth .
and it 's something that by the complexity , with the people 's use , grows and of use for the user interface with the application , bigger .
their own photos are with metadata <unk> , a different person has entered .
if , somebody the trouble has done and all this holy them , and <unk> , who they 're all , is my photo of the <unk> <unk> suddenly , with all these data <unk> and i can you when i started using to in this space , diving , in this <unk> , the photographs of other people use and a kind of <unk> <unk> social experience with the use of other <unk> do .
and of course , as all of these are the immense rich and virtual models of any interesting part of the earth , not just by <unk> or a satellite and so , were , but through collective memory .
thank you .
. i do you right ? their software to the key to look at a certain , within the next few years , all images , of someone in the world together to be used in principle , one another linked to be ?
yes . they do anything else than to explore .
if you want , made you to hyperlinks , between the slides .
and they do this because of the content in the slides .
and that 's really exciting , if you , the amount of semantic information to think , many of these images .
as if you a <unk> for images make , where they are <unk> and the text , the site of a lot of information about , which is an image that 's .
but how would it , if the image you with all their pictures that linked data ?
then is the scope of semantic <unk> and the amount of the , it makes , really enormous . it 's a classic <unk> .
<unk> , that 's really incredible . very much congratulations .
thank you very much .
i 'm going to you some things from my book about the , as i hope , in with other things are the they already have heard . and i 'm trying to yourself a couple of connections to create , if you this is n't have noticed .
i want with the start , what i call `` the official dogma '' i call .
the official dogma of what ?
the official <unk> of any western industrialized world societies .
the official dogma works so , when our target that to maximize the common good our own citizens , is , about this , all the <unk> the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is , liberty in , is good , valuable to make sense , a <unk> <unk> for the human .
when people to have , is about each of us for , the things to do , our very good to maximize and nobody has for us to decide .
the freedom to maximize that 's a choice to maximize that .
ever more choices , people have , <unk> more to have you . and ever more of freedom , they have , <unk> more good have you .
this is , i think so deep in our water ones that 's not in the sense to get it would to challenge .
and it 's also deeply in our lives are rooted in .
i 'm going to you some examples to give to us modern means that allows us .
this is my supermarket . not a big .
i just something about <unk> say .
there 's 175 <unk> in my store , if you the 10 different extra <unk> n't <unk> and 12 <unk> the they buy it might be able to a large number , own , lettuce <unk> make , in the <unk> case , not the 175 cases in the store , they really is .
so that is , like the supermarket .
and then they go to the <unk> business to a <unk> an -- the speakers , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , <unk> . and in a electronics is there 's so many <unk> facilities .
we can <unk> millions of <unk> facilities put out of the components , in a business are going .
they have to admit that a large selection is .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there 's a time , when i a boy was , you could every phone , the purchaser would have the you wanted , as he of ma bell was .
they have your phone <unk> . they have n't it <unk>
a consequence of it was , the phone ever broken .
these days are over .
we 've now almost a are choosing , phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
this are the mobile the future .
my favorite is the in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> torch around .
and they should that until now , not in your business , we 've seen , you can be sure , it soon be .
and what it does is it brings people to the business to walk and this question to imagine .
you know now what the answer on this question is ?
the answer is `` no . ''
it 's not possible a phone to buy that 's not to be much does .
in other aspects of life , very much <unk> than that to buy one of objects are , it the same explosion of choices to .
health -- it 's not longer the case in the united states that you to the doctor , and the doctor says , you what to do .
instead they go to the doctor and the doctor says , you , we could make a to make or we could b .
a , has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what you want to do ?
and they say , `` doctor , what should i do ? ''
the doctor says , a , has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you i would , doctor , what would you do ? ''
the doctor says , `` but i 'm not you . ''
the outcome is -- we call it `` patient , autonomy . '' that sounds like a good thing , but in the reality is a shift the burden of responsibility for that make of making of someone of something you know -- namely the doctor -- to someone in the n't know , and more likely to get sick , is , and why not in the best constitution , is a decision to meet -- namely the patient .
there 's a tremendous marketing , <unk> medicine for people like , and me , that , if you think about , does n't make sense of power , because we do n't you buy .
why i 'm going to you to us , if you ca n't we can buy ?
the answer is : you expect of us the doctor the next morning call and to a change of prescription to ask .
something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide show you do .
we inherit not an identity , we make you .
and we make us so often new , how we want .
that means that every day , if you the morning everybody waking up , you to make , for a kind of the person , you might be like .
in terms on marriage and family , there 's a time , in the <unk> was , almost every one had and that you so fast were married , as you could , and then so fast as kids got as you could .
the only true that election was `` who '' , when , and not what they then we did .
now , everything is just to have .
i teach , wonderful intelligent , students , and i 'll give you 20 percent less work as i used to did .
and that 's not because they 're less sense are , and not because they 're less carefully .
it 's because they do with other things too are , you ask , , `` me to marry , or not ? should i now to marry ?
should i later , marry ? should i just have kids , or just a career do ? ''
the 're all <unk> questions .
and they are these questions to answer regardless of that if that means that all the tasks to make the i do you <unk> and no good note in my class , to get .
and in the fact , they should do that . this are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we 're blessed , as carl shows , with the technology is the us to every minute of every day from any place on the planet to work -- until the <unk> hotel .
there 's actually a corner , of the i do n't tell you 'll , the <unk> works .
i 'm going to it , you do n't tell , because i use it wants .
so what it , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of the work of choices to meet , again , and again , and again , whether we work should or not work should .
we can our children the football , play watching , and we have our mobile phone , the a hip , and our blackberry , other hip , and our laptop , probably going on our lap .
and also if you all off are , every minute , we our child , <unk> one <unk> <unk> we ask you also , `` i should have this call assume ?
i should be on this email answers ? i should have this letter writing ? ''
and also if the answer to the question `` no , '' is going to it certainly your experience of <unk> your kid 's <unk> very different than it would have been .
everywhere , where we look closely , great things and little things that material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world , we lived looked like this .
so i want to say , there 's some of choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world , we now live looks like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is `` yes . ''
we all know what good that is , so i 'm about what 's bad that 's .
all these choices we have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effect , <unk> way is that he <unk> instead to free .
with so many options out of the you choose can , drops it , very hard , even to decide .
i 'm going to a one <unk> example of that there , a study about investing in the volunteers <unk> .
a colleague of me had access the <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million collaborators , and about . 2000 , different jobs .
and what they found was a 10 <unk> the of employers offered that took the participation , two percent .
they provide a 50 <unk> , -- 10 percent less on take part of as if you only five to would . why ?
because it 50 <unk> are , the selection are , it 's so hard to decide what you choose to , it on the morning <unk> .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow 's course never .
, do that 's not just means that people <unk> food to , if you in the retirement go , because they 're not enough money , on have , it means also , that make so hard is that they big <unk> your employers to miss .
by the not part give you to around the u.s. dollars per year on the <unk> , the happy would have been your contribution to reproduce .
of paralysis , is a consequence of to many options .
and i think it makes for the world that looks .
they want to the decision really make , if it for all eternity is , right ?
they do n't want the wrong investment fund to vote , or at the wrong <unk> .
so this is the a side effect . the other side effect is , even if we the paralysis get over and a decision to meet the end we have less happy with the result of choice , as well , if we the way i 've had to us between the less of opportunity to decide .
and there 's several reasons for this .
one of them is that requires the large variety of different <unk> , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect -- and , which <unk> 's been perfect ? it 's simple , imagine that they have a different decision , you would meet , the better would have been . and what happens is this <unk> an alternative that leads to you to the decision about five regrets , and this regrets of it 's negative , the average happiness , they of the <unk> decision that had , also , if it 's a good choice .
ever more opportunities there 's , <unk> easier is it does nothing to regret that 's very disappointing for the election , they meet .
secondly , what economists <unk> .
dan , gilbert , has a big point now , tomorrow 's made by he told as well , the way , we do things are , of it depends on to what we do it 's compare .
well , if it very much of alternatives to think there , it 's just , attractive properties to of alternatives , they exclude , that makes you less happy with the alternatives , they 're elected .
here 's an example . for the of them , no new york are , sorry i .
but here is , what they 're thinking to .
here 's a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real .
beautiful beach . great day . they have it 's all for themselves .
what could be better ? `` damn ! '' and the man who thinks , `` it 's an august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood , is the way .
i could directly , my house park . ''
and he spend two weeks of the idea being that he the way you missed , day about the day , a great parking lot .
<unk> reduce the average happiness , we go through our choice , get , also , if that what we chose to have been fantastic .
and ever more ways it to the choice , there , <unk> more attractive properties of choices be in the <unk> into account .
here 's a another example .
now , this cartoon that makes some statements .
he makes a statement about the right now to live and perhaps also about things that slow to do .
but a very important point , he does is , and if you for a thing to decide , you decide , and other things not to do .
and these other things like a lot of an attractive properties have , and it will , what they do n't be less <unk> do .
three : <unk> the expectations .
this , i met , when i my jeans exchange wanted .
i 'm jeans , almost all the time .
and there 's a time , it just jeans a kind of there , and they have you bought , and they have a bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and if you long enough by and often enough <unk> had , you have started , `` ok . '' <unk> .
so i went to new jeans to buy after many years of <unk> the old , and i said , `` i 'd like a few jeans , here 's my size . ''
and the sales , `` you want to greater risk , easy <unk> or the vastness of ?
you want to buttons , or <unk> ? rock or the acid <unk> ?
you want to jeans , with holes ?
you want to the bottom , far cut , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ... '' and so she he .
my jaw was down , and after i rebounding , i said , `` i have to the way , used to the only way . ''
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all these up jeans <unk> , and <unk> the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best put jeans , i ever had .
i had it better . all these choices made it me it better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book , to try it me , to explain .
the reason for that i got worse , i felt was , with all this available to the ways , and expectations for , for a few jeans is , went up .
i was very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations , as it you just in a way , there .
when you in a hundred species that came to damn , one of you have perfect , should be ,
and what i was good , but it was n't perfect .
and so by i what i get had to the what i expected , and what i was very disappointing in comparison to the what i expected .
this add of opportunities in the lives of people increases inevitably the expectations of the people have about how well , these opportunities to be .
and this leads to less of satisfaction with the results , also if the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing do this . because , if you it would , we know you all not what it here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used everything is better was when all bad was , when all bad was , it was for the people to experience to make the a surprise was .
now , in the world , we live -- we 're wealthy , the world citizens , perfection , as an expectation of -- the best for that you ever hope you can do is the things that are good as you do it of you expect .
they will never 's surprised . because your expectations , and expectations , <unk> .
the secret to <unk> -- that 's what they all come are -- the secret to <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i do with a woman , married , i 'm , and they really is very wonderful .
i have it does n't do better . i do n't <unk> .
but <unk> 's not always like a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of <unk> a bad <unk> jeans , if it just a way to buy there is , if you way that are , and you ask why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you can do ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans available are , and they buy a the disappointing is , and they ask why , who is responsible for ?
it 's also realized that the answer on the question is , you .
they have it better can do .
with a hundred different types of jeans , in <unk> , there 's no excuse for a mistake .
and so , when people make decisions , and also if the results make decisions are good , you feel , disappointed about , they 're blaming themselves .
clinical depression , exploded in the industrial world in the past generation .
i think about a <unk> -- not the only , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also the suicide , is that people experience have the disappointing are because their standards , so high . and then , if you these experiences , explain to , you think it would be your fault .
and so there is the <unk> , it gives us , generally better about the objective , and we 're bad feeling .
so let me tell you you .
this is the official dogma , that a that we all for really think , completely wrong . it 's not true .
there 's no question , that something that choice is better than no , but it follows are not the more selection is better than something that choice .
there 's a magical to a lot . i do n't know what it 's .
i 'm pretty sure that we do this point of time you have , the selection of our very good .
now , as a policy question -- i 'm almost finished -- as a policy question , the thing about the thinking . that what these are choosing to the world societies , is the material that wealth .
there 's many places in the world , and we have of many of you heard , their problem is not the to large selection is .
your problem is that they to bit .
so the things about the i 'm talking about are an odd problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what 's so incredibly frustrating and really is : steve levitt , you briefly yesterday about it tells how these more and hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a waste of money .
what i 'm going to tell is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it 's not just that they do n't help .
they do actually hurt .
you care for that we got worse , there are .
if something of what the people in our society to be so decisions to come to the past societies in which people to a choice 've shifted that , would not only that live in the people better , but our would also be improved .
economists call this is a <unk> application .
<unk> going to worry that 's all the better about -- not just the poor -- because all these large selection of us an .
finally , read you please do this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , `` ah ! what do this fish ?
you know it 's not possible in this <unk> . ''
<unk> imagination , a shortsighted of the world -- and that 's the way as i do it first you read .
ever more , but thinking about , <unk> more i came to the view , that the fish , i know .
because the truth is that if you that <unk> break , so that everything is possible , you have no freedom . they have that paralysis within .
if you that <unk> break , so that everything is possible , down , the average happiness .
they increase the paralysis and reduce the average happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost , of security to be limited -- possibly also for the fish , definitely for us .
but that <unk> be of a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for the misery , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i talked about some of these projects are already been talked to the human genome and what that means that could , and over the discovery of groups of genes .
actually start we of a new point , we have the biology and digitized , and now we try the digital code in a new phase of biology to get by we new life make and build .
we 've always trying to great questions to imagine .
what 's life ? it 's something , what i believe that many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we have different approaches tried to it until the minimum components to simplify it .
we have almost 20 years of digitized . when we that <unk> sequenced have was , the transition from the analog world of biology to digital world , the computer .
now we 're trying to ask , whether we live regenerate , or whether we new life create , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , the smallest genome of species of the , in the lab to replicate it can . and we tried to see if we that with a still a smaller genome to get there .
we 've done it on about a hundred genes to give up of the 500 or so , here .
but if we those metabolic map at the very simple is , in comparison to our . trust , they told me , that 's pretty straightforward . but if we all these genes you look at the we one after the other them , it 's very unlikely that this is to a living cell to would .
so we 've determined that 's the only way to forward is that chromosome in fact , to synthesize , what we allowed the individual components to <unk> and some of the fundamental question to imagine .
and so we started , with the question , we have a chromosome synthesize ?
that 's the chemistry of these really big molecule to what 's still never before was done ?
and , if we that , we can that chromosome start ?
a chromosome , is that way , just a piece <unk> chemical material .
our steps at the digitization of life were exponentially .
our ability of genetic code to write , very slowly developed , but still have increased . and our final point that would now on a standard exponential curve , put them .
we have 15 years ago , so i started .
it actually a few years , starting with a <unk> review , before we the first experiments that did .
like , it turns out is <unk> very difficult .
there 's tens of machines around the world , the little pieces of dna to make , 30 to 50 letters for but it 's a <unk> process , so we 've ever more you a piece of power , <unk> more fatal mistake to happen .
so we had a new way to do with the we these little pieces together and the mistake to correct could .

it 's a virus , the bacteria that kills himself .
we 're little pieces , made a <unk> and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase , came when we do this piece of <unk> chemical took and in a bacterium , gave , and this bacterium , i started the genetic code to read and made a viral particles .
the viral particles , then the cells that would and came back and killing e. <unk> .
recently , i did with the <unk> talked and they said that you this model , <unk> .
they were laughing , more than her , it here 's doing .
so we think that a situation is in the software in fact , your hardware can build in a biological system .
but we wanted , much on to go . we wanted a whole <unk> chromosome , building . it has more than <unk> letter of genetic code . so we thought we , we build it in it from the size of the virus , what we the size it <unk> were able to understand what the individual components of living cell .
design is the key , and if you with digital information in the computer to want to these digital information , really <unk> be .
when we the genome for the first in 1995 sequenced have was the <unk> at a mistake per 10,000 base .
we found the <unk> 30 mistakes . if we the original sequence that used to have it would never been possible <unk> .
a part of the design is it , and to the 50 letters for are and the with other <unk> pieces overlap to be able to smaller <unk> to build with these together .
we have a unique elements , here into .
you might have heard that we <unk> into .
you think about after , we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> of letters -- these letters actually encode about 20 amino acids , and here 's a single what for each of amino acids .
so we can the genetic code using to our words to write , sentences , thoughts .
initially we 've only signed .
people who was disappointed , that 's no new poetry .
we have the pieces that 's that we do you just with enzymes into could . it 's got enzymes , this repair and back to stitch back .
and we 've started pieces to create , starting with pieces of the five to <unk> letters <unk> , added these other to <unk> to do to this back into , to <unk> .
in every step , we have these pieces in the surplus produced by that we do you sequence we could , because we tried to a very robust that process to create what you in a minute going to see .
we tried to point of <unk> to get .
so , that looks kind of like a <unk> .
if we need to this really big pieces get -- with about 100,000 pairs of -- then we 're going to this is not just in e. <unk> grow . it exceeds all possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so i went we other mechanisms to .
we knew from a mechanism of <unk> <unk> is called the the biology is used to the dna to fix , those pieces stitch can .
here 's an example of them . there 's a organism , called <unk> <unk> the three million ] bike , radiation <unk> .
you see the top of the field to be a chromosome , just slightly apart , drops .
12 , 24 hours later , , everything again , together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms , that can do .
these organisms that can totally <unk> be , you can even in a vacuum .
i 'm absolutely make sure that live in space there and , can move , the search , <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that 's a lot of out there are .
here 's a <unk> of the molecule that we made have by we have this process have used -- actually , we 've just <unk> used with the right design the pieces we have you <unk> . yeast and so , then automatically .
this is not <unk> it 's a <unk> <unk> .
it 's so a big molecule that we do it even with the <unk> can see .
that are -- about a whole duration of six seconds .
this is the <unk> the we just recently finished have asked .
that are about <unk> letters , <unk> code . it 's the molecule , <unk> structure that ever of people who was created .
it has a <unk> of about 300 million .
if we do it with a <unk> of 10 and without <unk> print , it would <unk> pages encompass the only to this genetic code <unk> .
now , how to launch , we have a chromosome out ? how to activate , it ?
obviously is , it with a virus , very simple . it 's much more complicated with bacteria to deal .
it 's also be easier if you do it in <unk> how we do it are doing , you take just the nucleus out and there is a other into it , and that 's exactly what they all about this is cloning have heard .
at <unk> is that chromosome in the cell into but just recently we have shown that you a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to the other so , and these things activate it can .
we <unk> that chromosome one <unk> . roughly , are these two as far apart from how people and mice . we gave some <unk> to so we that chromosome choose to . we <unk> it , enzymes , all the proteins to destroy themselves . and it was very amazing when we do it in a cell , gave -- and they 're going to our very <unk> 's here we estimate --
this new chromosome , i went in the cell .
indeed , we thought , here the end is , but we tried to the process , on to .
this is the <unk> the evolution .
we find all kinds of species here , a second chromosome taken , or a third of <unk> , every time , thousands of characteristics , just a second to a species <unk> .
people , the , evolution , imagine , as a gene that to a moment changed will have a lot of the biology missed .
it 's got enzymes , the <unk> be called the fact , dna and digest .
that chromosome , that in the cell was has n't ; the chromosomes , we added to have already .
it was in the cell <unk> and i realized that other chromosome , when someone else material <unk> it and so we had the end just a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> , blue , because of the genes , we added .
and after a very short time had it all the characteristics of species lost , and <unk> completely in a new species , based on the new software , we in the cell , given .
all the proteins and changed , the membranes and changed , -- when we the genetic code read , it was that 's exactly what we <unk> .
it may sound like the genomic <unk> sound , but we can , by we the <unk> here , things quite dramatic change .
now i argues that this is not the <unk> is -- that 's based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argues that we possibly , are a new form of the cambrian explosion , to create in the 's massive whole new <unk> based on this digital design might be .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty clearly in terms on what we need .
we 're and of six and to nine billion people in the next 40 years <unk> .
now , it in my connection to ask : i was in the year from 1946 , born .
today are three people on this planet for every one of the year from 1946 exists , ; within one of 40 years , it 's four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , the fuel for six billion people .
it 's a challenge that for nine to offer .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion <unk> oil . that are a hundred million <unk> the day .
if we talk about the biological processes to think , or some process , that to replace , it 's a huge challenge .
then , of course , there 's the co2 from this material that in the atmosphere , lands .
we 've now , from our discoveries from the world , a database , about 20 million of genes , and i want to that believe that these the <unk> the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and you see , the diversity , the it was .
we and here in the first line , the boundaries of biological reality and , those of our idea .
we 've now technologies of fast <unk> , the to do what we <unk> genetics .
we 've now the possibility of a robot to build the millions of chromosomes , the day to make it can .
if you imagine those 20 million of genes to make or this process to optimize the octane make or drugs new vaccines , we can with a just small team more molecular biology to change as the last 20 years of science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we can , <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and so forth .
this is a shot of 's <unk> , the we work , with the you , actually sit down and new species on the computer to design <unk>
you know , we know , not necessarily as it looks like this is . we know exactly how their genetic code looks like this is .
we focus on us now on fuels the fourth generation .
they have recently , corn , to ethanol , what 's just a bad design experiment .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation of the relatively soon out to the much higher <unk> have to the octane or different types of <unk> .
but , how we think , the only way to biology is a big impact of no more increase the cost on food or the limitation of their having will have is , if we co2 as a material can see , and therefore we work , cells , this way to go ,
and we think that we the first with <unk> the fourth generation will be , and that in about 18 months .
the sunlight and co2 are a method --
-- but in our discovery of the world , we all species of different ways .
this is an organism , we 1996 , described .
he lives in the deep , <unk> miles deep , at virtually <unk> <unk> .
it into carbon in methane to the of hydrogen as energy .
we know if we <unk> co2 can use , which simply to <unk> brought to be able to <unk> the co2 in the fuel , to this process , power .
within a short time , we think , we could in the be able to a the basic questions of life to solve .
you know , we really -- <unk> goals , like the substitute the petrochemical industry . right . if you do n't that at ted i could do , where else ? a <unk> the energy .
but as we 're working at that the same two approaches for the development of <unk> to use .
they have it this year with the flu , seen , we 're always a year back on and have a dollar to bit when it comes to the right <unk> about .
i think that changed can be done by showing you <unk> vaccines around the <unk> .
so that 's like the future that might look with changes , can now the <unk> up to be with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and some <unk> .
we are light years of them away , people to improve . our goal is it just that we have a chance to have long enough to survive , that potentially to do . thank you .
the last ted conference , i an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised you back to come to them to explain how the machine works .
now , it 's so here . and for all those the time , not there were , the lhc is the science experiment , which you ever up with was -- 27 miles in diameter .
its task is it , the conditions to create , which is less than a <unk> second , after the universe <unk> -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it 's just so <unk> .
this is the machine , below , geneva .
we take pictures of <unk> in the detectors on .
so , this work i . he called , atlas detector , of feet in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
here 's a spectacular picture of atlas off in the construction , so you the scale .
the 10 . september the last year was the machine for the first time .
and this picture was from an atlas .
it was huge <unk> in control room .
it 's a picture of the first <unk> which the way to the lhc <unk> , you 're dealing with a part of the lhc <unk> to a rain from the particles at the detector <unk> to .
in other words , when we took this at 10 . september they saw , we knew that the machine works , a triumph .
i do n't know , whether this the biggest <unk> generated , this , when someone the google side to and the front page , and so i found .
it means that we have a cultural of the next to the scientific <unk> .
about a week later , there 's a problem with the machine , which with these <unk> here to do was -- this golden wires .
those wires run <unk> <unk> when the machine on <unk> .
now , the engineers , you will you look at and say , `` no , that they do n't . that are small wires . ''
you can that could afford , because if you very far <unk> , you going to call <unk> .
at minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , those wires , the tension endurance .
in the connections , between about <unk> magnet inside of the lhc , there 's a <unk> .
the heat , the wires slightly and <unk> <unk> <unk> suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the outcome .
so , that everything is still <unk> if you imagine that the magnets had about 20 tons weigh , and , about . 30 inches shifted .
we <unk> so about 50 the magnet
and they had to remove , what we also did .
we <unk> they brand new , <unk> you .
they 're now all over again on their way back .
against the end of the march , the lhc , again <unk> be .
we 're going to him turn , and expect the first data in june , or maybe july , collect to , and put our journey on , to see what the building blocks of the universe .
now , of course , on a kind <unk> those accidents , again , the debate the value of science and <unk> , such planetary boundaries . it 's easy , so something to reject .
i think the fact that 's so hard is the fact that we about our planetary boundaries out to reach , is the value of things like the lhc .
i mean <unk> words in english scientists to leave , humphrey <unk> , the , as i suspect , when he was the <unk> experiments in his <unk> defended us to be <unk> was michael <unk> , this , `` nothing is so dangerous for the development of human mind , as to that our scientific ideas on are , it 's no mysteries in the nature , there , our triumphs <unk> are , and that 's no new worlds to <unk> there . ''
thank you .
i 'm a writer .
to write books is my profession , but it 's kind of course , more than that .
it 's also my big , life , i love and fascination .
and i expect , not that , that ever change is .
but it 's recent something <unk> in my life and my career has happened , that me to be brought them , my terms to this work is completely to rethink together .
this to incident was , i recently a book written have -- a biography called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- that , they decided to different than all my previous books from some reasons , in the world beyond , and a <unk> , international <unk> .
the outcome is that i , no matter where i come to treat 'm as if i the of the <unk> .
seriously -- the of the <unk> !
the example , you very concerned , on me , and say , fear , they do n't you to this success never by going ?
they have not afraid of that they all their lives <unk> and never again a book , create , that anybody in the interest ? never again ? ''
okay , that makes it really the courage .
it would be however , even worse , when i do n't remember it would be that i ago about 20 years , when i was a teenager , first time of them told , writer , wanted to be , with the same kind of <unk> response , faced was 'm .
the people said , <unk> you 're not afraid , never success to have ?
you do not afraid that you , the humiliation of rejection killing ?
you do not afraid you to this craft , your life for <unk> and it never been something of and that you on a <unk> <unk> dreams are dying going -- your mouth is filled with the bitter ashes at the failure ? ''
so about , you know .
the answer -- the short answer on all these questions is : <unk>
yes , i 'm scared , all these things .
and the i had always .
and i ago , much more of fear , no <unk> would .
how algae , and other <unk> things .
but if it <unk> write about i 've been recently , about , and ask me : why ?
is this properly account ?
it 's logical , of someone to be that he 's fear that has the work to do to the he , get to feel ?
and what exactly the creative enterprises , go , we 're not about the other <unk> do -- in a way , how it other professions have n't do ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i ca , not a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , remember , in the he was asked , if he afraid to have , chemist .
with your <unk> , john -- how it 's you that ?
it was just not ago , you know ?
but to be fair to be -- the group of the chemist who have about the centuries , not the reputation of <unk> <unk> people get .
we who seem , but this kind of the reputation . but not just the writer , but the creative of genres in the first seem to call to have , mentally 's unstable .
everything , what they need to do , is , the bitter <unk> of really great minds , just from the 20 . century , at the young and a lot of their own hand , died .
and even the ones , not actually <unk> <unk> , the tracks of their talent , neglected , has been to be .
norman <unk> said , just going on his death in his last interview , <unk> my books , i was a little bit further <unk>
an extraordinary statement , you about her life can do .
but we our n't even , if we somebody something like to tell you hear , because we do this kind of statements for so long time you know , somehow we have the attitude , so moved and collective accepted that creativity and tired of course <unk> and that art -- the end -- always to <unk> leads .
the question , i now any here to ask you want is : is this idea for you completely in order ?
you feel , so i think ? because with just a tiny inch by looking at -- i feel with this attitude do n't think .
i think they really .
and i think they 're dangerous . and i do n't want to watch , the next century , by going .
i think it 's better , if we of creative encourage them to live .
and i know definitely , it for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to be able to start , this dark path of <unk> sort <unk> -- especially in the that , in the i in my career , am .
that means -- you see , i 'm pretty too young . i 'm only about . 40 years old .
i may yet another 40 <unk> in me .
and it 's extremely likely that everything , what i went from now , writing 'm from the world as the work , they will , and after the <unk> success of my last book came , right ?
i say it <unk> , because we 're here , yes , now all of friends -- it 's most likely to my greatest success , behind me is .
oh , jesus , for a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts , somebody to , to nine o'clock in the morning to , <unk> to drink . and that i want to do n't .
i 'd continue this work to do , i love .
so this is the question : how ?
after some time the <unk> seems to me , to continue to write to , a kind of <unk> psychological construct design must .
somehow i have to go from now , find a way , to write a safe distance to real disconnect between me and my very natural <unk> about the response on the <unk> will be .
while i in the last year after the models for looking for you have to to do this , i also in the past , for and i tried to other societies have to find , to see , if you might better or <unk> ideas about it had as we , as you 're creative can help , with the emotional risks to deal , with the creativity are connected .
this for led me into the old greece and the old rome .
please follow they told me , because the circle , is , again , close .
but in the old greece and rome have the people do n't believe that creativity of people coming , okay ?
they believed that creativity is a kind <unk> <unk> was , from a distant , and unknown source to the people coming -- from <unk> , and unknown .
the greeks called the divine <unk> of creativity <unk> .
from socrates is known that he 's it was , he had a <unk> , the him the wisdom , and distance , which .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative spirit of a <unk> .
this is great . the roman was n't really , a genius , especially <unk> individual .
they believed that a genius , this kind of a magical <unk> beings who was , of the did was that 's literally in the walls of <unk> lives -- about so how <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artists speak at the work of invisible <unk> and the outcome of work to make it would .
that 's brilliant , there is it , there 's the distance , of the i talked about -- the psychological construct the you of the follow your work to protect .
and everybody knew that 's so it , right ?
the artists of <unk> was going on certain things done , like , for example , much <unk> , right ?
if your work , brilliant was <unk> you 're not all look for you <unk> . everybody knew you to this <unk> genius did , that you helped .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely , your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew , your genius , was something <unk> .
so we have the people in the west really long time about creativity that .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this great idea . and this great idea was , let us the human individual , into the center of the universe to imagine -- about all the gods and mysteries . and there 's no room , for anything mystical creatures , the commands by the divine .
it 's the beginning of the rational humanism , and the people began to believe that creativity is completely gone from their own individual came .
the first time in the story to hear you people , or those artist , a genius call -- instead of that he 's a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , a naked person to allow that he thinks , he or she was like that 's been , like the pelvis and the essence , and the source of divinity , creative , <unk> , an <unk> is a little bit to be much responsibility to you a <unk> , human psyche <unk> .
it 's how someone to ask , the sun to swallow .
that <unk> and distorted , egos , and it 's all these <unk> expectations , the success .
i think that this <unk> our artists , the last 500 years <unk> .
and , if this is true , -- and i think , it 's true -- is the question :
we can it change ?
maybe to a <unk> understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creative back .
maybe not .
maybe we that <unk> from 500 years , rational humanism , not just in a <unk> talk eradicate world .
and there 's certainly people in this audience , really fair scientific doubt <unk> were about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , the people <unk> and <unk> on their projects <unk> . apply them .
i 'll probably not all of them on this journey to take them .
but the question , i <unk> want is : why not ?
why not so think about ?
because it was as much sense like all other , of the i heard have , if it 's why was , absolutely crazy <unk> <unk> the creative process to explain .
a process , the , -- like everyone knows , it ever has tried to something to make -- so in other words , actually , everyone here -- not always been properly acts .
in the fact , he can , sometimes these are <unk> feel .
i had recently , like that encounter , when i the extraordinary american poet <unk> stone , i met , well over 90 's , but all their lives for a poet . they told me , when you in <unk> virginia up out on the fields , working . they said , they would feel and you can hear like a poem is about the landscape on you <unk> .
they said , it would like a <unk> move from air ,
the about this country , they <unk> would .
they felt , if it came , because it would the earth , under your feet , <unk> bring .
you know , in such a moment , only one could do . and this was -- in their words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they ran out how the devil , house while they of this poem by being . it was only about , fast enough to a paper and a pen to get to , so you it , if it , you through <unk> to capture and the sheet to could .
at another painting was n't you fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but they reached the house , and the poem would roll , you through and you missed it . they said , it would go on about the country to and -- how they said -- <unk> a other a <unk> .
and then there 's these moments -- the part i 'll never forget -- they said , it moments , there in which they it almost missed .
so , she runs to the house and for and after the paper and the poem <unk> , you through and you and a pen , just as it , they <unk> and then -- i said , you -- it was so when i 'd love with your other hand , after them and it to put get .
they <unk> the poem , his tail and moved it back in your body and took it on the paper .
at these opportunities that came from the poem <unk> and intact the paper , -- but it backwards -- from last word for the first .
when i think that i heard , i thought , `` this is incredibly -- that 's exactly how to my creative process <unk>
that 's do n't like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel .
i 'm a <unk> . to work to can i have to every day to the same time up , and sweat , i <unk> and really , awkward <unk> .
but even i in my <unk> 've sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess that many of you that 's also have done .
even i had to work or ideas , from a source of me <unk> , i really did n't identify .
what is that for a thing ?
and how to we do with in the relationship with no about our minds to lose , but for us in the opposite , even at <unk> health to hold ?
for me is the best of living for example , as you this to create , the musician and tom <unk> . i could it a few years ago , for a magazine interview .
we talked , about this topic . and you know what ? the most of time of his life was tom the embodiment of <unk> modern artist , trying to this <unk> creative impulses , in him <unk> , to control and with them getting .
but then he was older and quiet . he told me that he 's one day on a <unk> in go to los angeles was driving . and there has changed , everything for him .
he went with high speed as he suddenly a fragment of a tune hear the , how it at inspirations are often is , for him <unk> hard it 's . and he wants you have . you is <unk> . he <unk> then , but he can you ca n't .
he has not a piece of paper , he has n't a pen , he has no <unk> .
he begins , this old <unk> in him up , like , `` i 'm going to this thing to lose and i 'm from this song on forever being able to be .
i 'm not good enough , i do it ''
but rather than in out to get , i heard he just on .
he ended the <unk> and did something completely new .
he looked at just in the sky and said , <unk> , you do n't see that i car to drive ? ''
<unk> i , when i could just a song write it ?
if you really exist want to come to a <unk> moment , again , when i have to you care .
if not , <unk> today , somebody else .
go , and <unk> leonard <unk>
be whole <unk> , after that changed .
not the work itself . the was to continue , so dark as time and ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> , it is , was as when he was the genius from , it took , where he 's nothing more than having trouble was and it to <unk> where he sort came from . he realized that 's no <unk> , <unk> thing had to be .
it was a <unk> , miraculous , bizarre , working there , sort of a conversation and tom , and the <unk> , <unk> thing that 's not , tom .
when i do this story of you have changed it also a bit of the way i worked and it has to me , even have saved .
this idea that saved me when i in <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . i fell in a sort of <unk> the <unk> in the we all the fall , if we , something that work and it does n't . you <unk> , to think that 's a disaster . this is the worst book , that ever was written .
not just bad , but the worst , all time .
i started to think , i should the project , just <unk> .
but then i remembered that , like tom , in the free to heaven 've had and i tried it .
i took so my view from the manuscript , and talked my comment in the direction of empty the corner of space .
i spoke out loud , `` stop to , you thing , you and i know them , if this book , not brilliant , is that 's not completely off my fault , is , right ?
because you see , yes , everything , what i , <unk> . i do n't have more than that .
if you do it so much better have you want to have to you here show up and your of the deal <unk> .
okay . but , if you that does n't do -- you know what , then , devil with it .
i 'm still on writing , because that is my job .
and i want to please to protocol , give , today for my part of jobs here <unk>
because -- the end it 's how to follow . , centuries have , in the deserts <unk> people to <unk> with the holy <unk> and music around the long hours this were -- to <unk> .
this fixed these were always been great , because the dancers were highly professional and they were fantastic .
but to and again , very rare , was something special . of the performers was actually <unk> .
and i know that you know , what i mean , because i know that they all in your life , once a sort of performance have seen .
it was when i would the time <unk> and the dancer , through a kind <unk> step . he did n't something different than he 's ever before has done -- a thousand , nights earlier . but everything we added , together .
and very suddenly appeared , he did n't even more longer in human .
he was from up and of the bottom up and everything <unk> , by a <unk> fire .
as something that at this happened to know the people what that was . they called it at his name .
they put the hands together and began to sing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , <unk>
this is god , you know ?
interesting was historical footnote : when the <unk> <unk> <unk> brought you this practice . the <unk> changed , over the centuries of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that you still , <unk> and <unk> sounds .
if a high performers in spain , <unk> , something magical has done , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> 's , there is it , a <unk> at the god .
and this is great , because we need that .
but the tricky part of what follows the next morning , if the dancer , up and see that 's 11 o'clock , a tuesday -- is -- and he did n't no longer a <unk> of god in , wearing .
he is merely a <unk> mortal with <unk> at . and maybe he will never again to these heights up .
and perhaps will never again , somebody god 's name out , when he , about . but what is he then with the rest of his life begin ?
that 's hard .
this is a the <unk> <unk> of creative life .
but maybe it must not , so full <unk> be , if you of the beginning , not believed that have the most aspects of your she of you <unk> .
if you might just believe that you a <unk> are -- of <unk> source for a <unk> time your life , the , somebody else being passed is , if they finished with it .
if we start , so think about , changes that everything .
so i started to think and so i think with safety in the past several months , while i , the book working , that 's going to appear to -- as the dangerous , <unk> , and expectations <unk> my <unk> success .
what i always ourselves to say to , when i talk about this crazy 'll , is : i not afraid .
she was n't <unk> .
do just your job .
that continue for your contribution , what 's also , he would be may .
if your job that dance is , dance .
if , that stupid divine genius , that you to the side asked that 's going to decide , for a moment , yet from the miracles through your effort to show , <unk> ! ''
and if not , dance , and yet your dance .
and <unk> ! '' for you , despite all .
i think that , and i do that sense , we should that teach .

thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i have these slides , shown to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , for been three million years of the size of the bottom of 48 states had to 40 percent down .
but this <unk> not going strong enough , the seriousness , this particular problem , there 's not the thickness of the ice shows .
in a sense , is the arctic <unk> the core , heart of our global <unk> .
they grow in winter and -- in summer .
the next slide , i 'm going to show , is a <unk> what in the last 25 years happened .
that <unk> is with the red , a .
as you see , it 's on the <unk> tagged iraq . this is the annual ice in winter , and it -- in summer .
that 's called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which of the body , here <unk> .
in 25 years will it from here , here 's gone to be .
this is a problem , the warming the frozen reason to the arctic ocean <unk> , in the 's great quantities , <unk> carbon , there , which , when he <unk> , of microbes , methane , which is .
compared with the entire amount , <unk> materials in the atmosphere , could , this amount to double , if we have this critical point that cross .
already today <unk> in some of flat lakes in alaska and methane itself from the water .
professor <unk> walter the university in alaska 's with one another task force to a other flat lake last winter , traveled .
wow !
you about it . the question is , how it 's going to us <unk> .
and a reason is , this enormous heat up the greenland from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume , are much bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know , like the sea through <unk> up here <unk> you into the ocean .
these are rivers , rapidly to .
the other end of the planet , the antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
last month had signed up the researchers that the entire continent now a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> the a few <unk> up is , is very strong in the melting .
this is 20 a level , greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see up new lakes , a few years ago , the glaciers were .
40 percent of people in the world get the half of their <unk> of this <unk> .
in the andes , is this glacier , the <unk> for this town .
the <unk> have , <unk> .
but if you <unk> , will also the most of water <unk> .
in california was a 40 percent reduction in the <unk> the sierra seen .
this in terms of the <unk> .
and the predictions , you read have , are seriously .
this <unk> in the world to a dramatic increase , fire .
and the catastrophe , around the world have in a really <unk> and that never an unprecedented <unk> gained .
four times so many in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you this in the historical context of , you can see , what it <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 produced , 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
you look , the area of the eastern pacific , right , from the continent <unk> and both the indian <unk> , where it 's a <unk> decline of oxygen in the waters there .
the largest single factor for the global warming , next to logging , which is 20 percent is , there is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is that 's nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states are a the two major <unk> , together with china .
and the suggestion was , many more <unk> to build .
but we start , a change .
here are the the last few years , painted , , with some green alternatives , proposed .
<unk> there 's a political an in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> spent to clean coal to apply that , already a contradiction in , is .
this reminded me , something .
the christmas around them off , at me to home in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> .
they have it <unk> in the news .
this is in our whole country , <unk> <unk> america .
this happened to the christmas .
one of the commercials , <unk> , christmas was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy -- .
it 's in the shell and there in america , and he helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> going to every day , clean .
he 's an affordable , and <unk> , and the workers will remain in <unk> and the bread .
this is the source of the most of coal in west virginia .
the most <unk> is the ladder of <unk> coal .
let me tell you a very clear to say , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they do n't know , what they talk .
so , the alliance for <unk> two campaigns to live launched .
this is a , a part of her .
the <unk> we see climate change , as a serious at risk for our business .
so we have it gives us to the top <unk> , put it , a <unk> <unk> spending to a <unk> the way to the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is not much .
we think , she 's clean -- and it smells , still good .
so , do you n't worry about the climate .
leave you the quiet for us .
<unk> coal , they have a lot of them .
so you make us a tour of modern , clean <unk> do .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it 's the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal of the main reasons for the global warming is the remarkably , clean <unk> , you see here , changes everything .
if you look at it , right , this is the today , clean <unk> .
finally , it up , the positive alternative , with our economic challenge and our challenge the national security .
america 's in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread , this all together , is our dependence of <unk> <unk> like the dirty and coal and <unk> oil .
but now , there 's a bold , new solution to us from this <unk> able to free .
<unk> america , 100 percent cleaner , electricity in new , within the next 10 years .
a plan , america , back to work to bring to us safer , to make and to help the global warming , to stop .
finally , a solution , the big enough is , our problems to solve .
<unk> america in new . they find more out .
this is the last thing .
it 's going to a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest way , our dependence of the old , <unk> <unk> , our world , one , to reduce .
the future is here . wind , the sun and a new energy system .
new investments to be good paid for jobs to create .
<unk> america in new . it 's time , reality to accept .
there 's an old african saying : `` if you quickly , you want to go alone .
if you very far come you want to go together . ''
we need to go far come , and it quickly .
thank you .
i want to begin to you to ask , the time your childhood <unk> , when you with <unk> played .
while they realized , as you the hands out and <unk> , the <unk> pick up and moves , learn how they actually , to think , and problems through the understanding and change <unk> importance to solve .
the spatial can think is closely with being connected , how we have a lot of our environment to understand .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of our interaction with real world objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> <unk> , i started to wonder : what would be , if we computers use it would , instead of <unk> , the , as a digital <unk> on a flat <unk> moves -- what would be , if we do with both hands to intervene could and data , physically take and they like to organize could , how we do it want ?
this question was so <unk> that we need to exploration of the answer to and <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of <unk> .
you can with the hand would move to be , you can , they 're able to you can use their movements that and they have a screen and a <unk> .
so much more importantly , are are physically , why you like <unk> merely by that reach the hands and access can move .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools <unk> , and a consciousness for their movements that , each of see , and the intricacies of our <unk> with you see , then we can start with the exploration of new and <unk> <unk> start .
i 'm going to start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and if i took him in a direction <unk> , the video forward , played back ; if i took him in the other direction <unk> , it 's it backwards .
and this interactive portraits , take , one another true .
if i do you so next to put , <unk> that their interest .
if you <unk> surrounded these are going to realize you that , and we can do something that nervous .
and they feel as their movements and the propensity .
an interesting a result of interactions , we need to recognize started , was , we everyday gestures on the data to be , how about color , to go into the way that you this with <unk> does .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> and i can you use to paint in the in the middle to <unk> , where they then it up .
if we do it might overdo , we can get a little <unk> .
there 's also , some kind of opportunities in the education , how many languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we the people the possibility of the rapid <unk> give and the results are immediately see you want .
here , i 'm ... this is a fibonacci , i do with a simple <unk> <unk> .
this is a game with words , that a kind of <unk> and <unk> is .
basically , you get any of on every <unk> to <unk> letters and while you 're trying to words to form , this about a dictionary through .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , mixed and you has a new <unk> and new ways to try .
thank you .
that are some kids , on a trip to the media lab up . i could you to move , it to try and have a video of them .
they have it really loved .
a more interesting that at this kind of applications is that you the people not a lot of instructions , there must be .
all of what you say to this is `` is the words , '' and you know exactly what to do .
here are still a few people , it to test .
this is our youngest <unk> down there right .
it was , that he the <unk> just a pile i wanted .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted a <unk> for <unk> develop .
this is <unk> .
he can see new characters in the scene , to , by he the <unk> from the table <unk> , this figure shows .
here , he the sun <unk> .
the sun goes on
now out he 's a <unk> in the scene .
the <unk> <unk> .
good work ! yeah !
by he the <unk> shaking and you next to put he can the characters and interact and let ...
-- his own story to invent .
hello !
it 's a story with open the end , and he can decide , how they developed .
flying his cat .
the last example , for that i am today , you have , it to show , is a <unk> for <unk> , that we recently have evolved and in the <unk> as sound , like <unk> the bass , and the drums operate .
each has four different variations ; you can choose , which you use to .
and you can make these sounds in the sequence <unk> , you again in any patterns , organize it can .
and you <unk> you , by showing you just a <unk> , a <unk> holding .
there are the effects , you live can change , like . hall and filter .
you connect him with a particular sound , and it tends to him , then , it up .
and then , <unk> effects , like the speed and volume , you on the entire sequence that gets .
so let me , .
we start , in the we the <unk> in two <unk> <unk> and this in a series organize , they expand and a little bit more the voice to add .
now i 'm i have a bass , add .
now i 'm still something like drums to do .
and now i 'll just hook the filter up with the drums , so i the effect , live control .
i can the entire sequence speed , by i think that at the , or other direction <unk> .
and now i 'll just hook the filter , with the bass , for something more expression .
i can the sequence , while they 're going <unk> .
it i have to do n't you in <unk> plan , but you improvise , they meanwhile prolong or <unk> .
and closing i can the entire sequence <unk> , by i the <unk> after the left tend to .
thank you .
as you so we can see , is my desire , new <unk> to the better to the fit , like our brains and body work .
and today , i had time , you a part of these new <unk> and some of possibilities of to show , what we in our lab to work .
the idea , i them with the way to give you want , is that we , the threshold to this new generation of <unk> to the interaction with digital media are the information in our world to bring , our demands is .
thank you ,
i 'm on the talks with you all .
