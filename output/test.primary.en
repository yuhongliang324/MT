when steve lopez , <unk> the los angeles times , one day the streets the center of los angeles , , he 's a beautiful music .
they came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless , on a violin playing , the only have two strings .
a lot of you 're going to the story know , because of <unk> article about it was later a book , it again <unk> , by robert <unk> junior when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> studied and whose <unk> career <unk> early through his <unk> schizophrenia finished .
nathaniel left <unk> , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , it as <unk> on the streets of <unk> row the center of los angeles .
i recommend you all , <unk> book to read or at the film at that they could not just the wonderful connectedness understand that between these two men are born , but also , like the music that link them in and you end up the instrument , if this <unk> allows us is that <unk> , nathaniel away from the street to get .
i met mr <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a demo of <unk> , and <unk> symphony of and came out of the stage to me to imagine .
he was in a very <unk> and <unk> of the yo-yo ma , hillary clinton and as the dodgers it never going to baseball world series of . and it all of the <unk> <unk> of the first violin the last sentence of <unk> <unk> symphony .
so we 're on the music to talk , and a few days later i got an email , in the state that nathaniel in <unk> at me was .
i have to mention that nathaniel a medical treatment <unk> , because he was already with <unk> and with <unk> and <unk> treated , a trauma to him his whole life being .
as a little bit about it is now , particularly prone to these <unk> <unk> , who are at times as bad , and he days away , in the streets of <unk> row <unk> , the horror and the <unk> of his own mind to .
and in just as a <unk> was a nathaniel , when we do with our first have to walt disney <unk> hall started . he had this 'm wrong <unk> in his eyes and <unk> completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how , it 's the way to sleep poison .
i was afraid , not <unk> , but i was afraid that i met him to be that he was in one of these states get , and i used to him to its relationship to violin destroy could , when i started to <unk> and <unk> and exciting forms of <unk> <unk> to talk .
so i just started to play .
i was the first sentence of <unk> <unk> .
and as i was playing , i noticed that in <unk> eyes a <unk> shift to go .
it was , as if it under the impact of an invisible <unk> said , a chemical response , the catalyst for game .
<unk> <unk> anger <unk> in understanding , in a steady curiosity and <unk> .
and the way through a miracle , he violin and started , the ear some clips from <unk> to play and asked me then , you to end to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we then , about music to talk , starting from the stream of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .

he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i would just by my colleagues in the <unk> of los know .
and music playing and about music talked about it was that <unk> , confused man who you have the streets of los in fact , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> <unk> musician .
music is . music is us .
for nathaniel means music <unk> health .
because the music is it , his thoughts and delusions of your imagination and creativity in a real <unk> .
and so <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that right now the nature of art .
and this is the reason that we need to do : so we do something that in us all , deep inside the inside is , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to the fact forms .
and the fact that <unk> gets us , and moves , inspired by and unites us .
what nathaniel <unk> , it took him the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music took him back into a family of musicians , he understood that might be a talent realized and it <unk> .
and i 'm again and with nathaniel music , whether it in the walt disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> row , because it reminds me , why i musicians become .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play that i <unk> the <unk> stolen .
i hope you pardon me .
so i have in a fish have known .
i only two loved .
this first , that was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a more fish , <unk> , good <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was in <unk> after the supposedly of standards of sustainability <unk> .
you could be so i think about to feel , it .
i had with that beauty of a relationship of several months .
and one called the head of the company , and said , if i look at an event <unk> could talk about the sustainability the farm .
`` of i said , .
there was a company that to solve trying to know what this incredible problem for our chefs . how do we fish in our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years we have the ocean <unk> how we are <unk> beaten .
it 's hard to the destruction of <unk> .
ninety percent of the fish , that we love that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> , <unk> , they 're collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so , i guess or <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
a lot of arguments against it . <unk> <unk> the environment , of them anyway , and they are inefficient , let 's tuna , a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
so , 15 pounds <unk> are necessary to do you take a million pounds <unk> get .
not very sustainable .
like it 's not very good .
so here was finally got a company that was trying to get it .
i wanted to you 've been supported .
the day before the event i called the head of <unk> for the company .
we call him don .
`` don , '' i said , `` just about the facts right , you are famous for it , so far out the grow that their the environment is not <unk> . ''
`` this is true , '' he said , `` we 're so far out that the waste of our fish that 's going to be concentrated . ''
and then put it 's going to add , `` we 're basically what 's own world .
these <unk> of <unk> to 1 , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one thing , which feeds her ? ''
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said , put on .
and that night was i in bed and thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , about the event , don .
i said , don , which for example , sustainable proteins .
he said , he <unk> n't it . he 'll <unk> .
now , i <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could me a <unk> answer , until i finally , <unk> biologists <unk> .
we call it also don .
`` don , '' i said , `` what for example , sustainable proteins .
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and to feed of . ''
i said , `` how much percent <unk> <unk> 's chicken ? `` .
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , don , which is unsustainable , chicken , fish to the ? ''
there was a break in the line and he said , there 's just too much chicken . ''
i <unk> me from this fish .
no , not , because i was a <unk> <unk> and <unk> am .
so i 'm actually .
no , i <unk> actually from this fish <unk> because , i swear to god , the fish out of having a chicken <unk> .
this second fish , this is a different kind of <unk> .
it 's the romantic sort of the way in fact , the better and his fish are learning , you the fish the more love .
i have the first in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
a <unk> and had for about this fish .
it 's kind <unk> .
he came on the table with a light , almost <unk> the color .
the chef came up with him <unk> .
hold twice .
amazingly he was still delicious .
who can be a fish so good taste , after he <unk> 's why ?
i ca n't know , but this guy is it .
we call him how much indeed , he miguel .
and no , he has the fish do n't <unk> and he 's not a chef . at the way that you and i underneath .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner <unk> .
it 's near the <unk> of the stream <unk> .
and in the 1980s , the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they <unk> <unk> on , which basically what wetlands .
they did this , by the country <unk> .
they built this complex of <unk> , and they <unk> water from the country out and out into the river .
now , they could n't make that was , not be economically .
and ecological it was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of birds , what to this place of birds are .
and so in 1982 a spanish company with green the country went out .
what they 're doing ?
they have the flow of water vice versa .
they have literally the dials <unk> .
instead of the water <unk> used to the channels , to the water back <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a <unk> acre <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , eel -- and yet , how and his company called the ecological destruction , vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they have that have never seen .
and stare out on the horizon , the one million miles away , and what you 're <unk> channels and the density , <unk> march .
i was there was n't long time with how .
he 's a guy , three parts by charles darwin and part of `` a crocodile for <unk> .
okay ? because we were and were told us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> to my <unk> , and how does it alone a <unk> .
and picks it a rare <unk> forth .
well said he the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here to see here 's a pattern of <unk> that it to the <unk> giraffe you of .
it turns out that how the part of his career in <unk> national park in africa spent .
i asked him , as he was to such a <unk> .
he said , fish , i do anything about a fish .
i 'm an expert in the connection . ''
and then it and going to more <unk> of those birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and do n't get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this <unk> piece <unk> fish that i am <unk> .
so i met him <unk> . i said , `` how , how does it that your fish so good like ? ''
he showed up with the algae .
`` i know , young , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , that 's unbelievable .
but what we eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
well , he goes on me to tell that it 's a <unk> system is that the fish food , what they 're in the wild food .
the <unk> biomass of phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
it 's no food .
so from a farm is that they are not feeds ?
later on day i went on this site of how around and i asked him , i said , for a place , the way of course , to be , '' different than a farm , that i ever been , `` how measures to succeed ? ''
the moment , it was , as if a <unk> a <unk> demands .
and we bow to the corner and we provided the most incredible <unk> , thousands and thousands <unk> flamingos , literally <unk> carpet so far the eye is .
`` it 's success , '' he said .
`` check out their bellies on the pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , `` how to <unk> they 're not your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
now , last year were on this site 600,000 birds , more than 250,000 different types .
it is the largest and one of the private <unk> in all of europe .
i said , `` how is a good <unk> <unk> not the last thing that you on a <unk> have to ? ''
he <unk> his head , no .
he said , we build <unk> , not hard .
this is a <unk> network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
the <unk> so the belly the more than the system . ''
okay , let 's the think , a farm , the animals are not feeds and a farm , their success of health of <unk> measures .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way to these flamingos of <unk> n't even there .
they <unk> in a city 240 miles away , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning to fly it comes 240 a half the farm .
and every night and they 240 miles away .
they do it , because they 're the <unk> white line of <unk> <unk> follow .
seriously .
i had to a journey of the penguins to , looking at how .
i said , `` how to fly it comes 240 a half of the farm and fly and then 240 miles away at night ?
you make it for the children ? ''
he looked at me , as if i just a song from whitney houston quoted .
he said , `` no , they do it , because the food is better . ''
i do n't have the skin of my beloved <unk> mentioned , delicious , and i do n't like <unk> . i do n't you <unk> . i do n't you <unk> .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i <unk> almost never going to it .
and yet , when i put them in this restaurant in <unk> , i did you do n't want to <unk> <unk> .
they <unk> sweet and in , as if you bites by the ocean , take .
i mentioned , versus how and he <unk> .
he said , `` the skin is like a swam .
it is the last <unk> , before something in the body <unk> .
it 's the evolution has evolved to <unk> <unk> . ''
and then put it 's going to add , `` but our water has no <unk> . ''
okay , a farm , the fish do n't feeds on a farm , their success is the success of <unk> .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm , no <unk> , <unk> this massive , because the water , it through this farm it comes from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , all the things to lead , of which are today to have , they have to lead , chemical pollutants , <unk> of <unk> .
and if it through the system fighting , and this leaves is the waters clean , how it <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm , the animals are not feeds , not just a farm , their success of health of <unk> measures , but a farm , literally a <unk> is , and not just for this fish , but for you and me .
because when the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i met him , and that they should also do , because these <unk> , romantic , is also <unk> .
you might say that she 's a recipe is for the future good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> .
what we need is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the foods really good taste .
but for many people that 's a little radical .
we are not <unk> , we <unk> . we are lover .
we love <unk> , we love little <unk> , we 're talking about regional food . we eat the organic .
and if they claim that the things are capable of the good food tell is somebody somewhere on and says , `` hey guys , i love pink flamingos , but how they get the food ?
how they get the food ? ''
can i be honest ?
i like this question .
no , not , because we have enough calories are , the world more than just to feed .
a billion people are today <unk> .
one billion -- that is more than ever seen -- because <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i like this question is not , because they 're the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years about it .
<unk> grain of <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , chemicals in the earth , chicken , fish , and the time has the agribusiness just wondered : `` if we 're more people do feed , as you can it already be ? ''
this was the <unk> . it was the <unk> . it was the <unk> the american agriculture .
we should you call that you is , a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> that fast <unk> capital <unk> , this is exactly the production is .
this is n't <unk> , and it 's not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened , not because <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through <unk> country , not by pumps , but through fresh water , not by <unk> , but by these forests , and not by <unk> and nets , but through the fish in the sea .
they want to the food ?
let 's start with the question : how we 're going to feed ?
or better , how can we have to create that every community <unk> , to feed ?
to do that , and not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are at <unk> and it has never seen something really good for food produced .
let 's what the ecological model .
this is that in two billion years <unk> <unk> .
so look at how to farmers like how .
facilities that do n't think for yourself , facilities that restore instead <unk> , facilities , the <unk> grow rather than just hard to farmers who do n't just <unk> , but experts of relationships .
because they are the ones who also experts to flavor .
and if i really quite frankly , they 're a better chef than i ever be going .
you know , it 's my right , because if it into the good food , she 's delicious .
thank you .
if i want to one thing <unk> want it is that the totality of data that we consume , it 's when the sum of pieces and instead of the <unk> to think i hope you think about how we information that can use that pattern up and so trends , who otherwise would n't be visible become .
so , what we see here 's a typical <unk> looking at which .
the program that i 'm , is a little experiment .
it 's <unk> and what i 'm going to <unk> can do is that i went to a particular cause filter , let 's crashes .
and immediately i see a different patterns that makes .
and it , because in <unk> here the people on <unk> , and over here at <unk> .
we can one step further out and <unk> the data and new and see that <unk> and cancer that <unk> number , but not for each other .
if we now go and the age <unk> , let 's 40 years or a younger than we see that accidents , in the cause is about the the people are doing .
and who <unk> see that this is especially for men true .
you see so that look of information and data in this is a lot of swimming in a living <unk> you of .
and if we do this for raw data can make why do n't even for this themselves ?
what we now have here are the <unk> every single `` <unk> <unk> '' that was printed .
it 's all here . it is everything online .
you can do after my talk about in their <unk> test .
with <unk> you can <unk> in a decade .
you can <unk> in a specific year .
you can go directly to a certain copy off .
now if i 'm here looking , i see the athletes , in this copy appear and the <unk> .
i 'm a <unk> armstrong fan , so click i go and to me all spending show in which <unk> armstrong mentioned .
now , if i just a <unk> of getting to could i think , `` okay , what if i do with the subject <unk> look ? ''
so i one step back and <unk> the view .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of that if you in that way information <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , looking for you could n't or <unk> not just .
you do something that actually a bit different .
it 's something between and we think it changes the way of information to be used .
i 'd like this idea now a bit further do with about what a little bit crazy .
what we 've done is , we have every single <unk> , and you on a little <unk> reduced .
the <unk> contains a quick <unk> and a symbol for the area of them coming .
i 'll just about the top 500 of <unk> <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we can a lot of things .
you do we get a sense of the themes that look at wikipedia , <unk> .
i 'm going the subject <unk> `` vote .
now , after i <unk> the elected , you know i that the <unk> that the most of <unk> time <unk> `` people of '' .
this is really important , there is an insight is that do n't in a single <unk> .
this is just to see if you one step back and it looks at .
<unk> on a certain that <unk> i can then in the time <unk> `` people of the inside out , and all together .
now if i all these people consider know i that the majority of <unk> , some people come from the science . some , nor less likely to come from the economy . here 's my boss , and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , a bono 's a ted prize winner .
so we can now start off and a look at all of ted prize winner .
you see , we 're surfing on the web the first time as if it also really a net , not just by side to side , but much <unk> .
and so i want to what else to show what a surprise .
i 'll show you 're just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i do n't it a browser call ; it 's not a browser , but you can websites to look -- and we bring these <unk> to every single one page as this .
so i can one step back , and directly to a specific <unk> off .
this is so important , because you just by this at the websites in this kind of the way , all the <unk> in the same kind of the way to look .
so i can in my course zoom in a certain <unk> .
here is the state the demonstration , i go to be .
and i can kind of all that i 've been , again <unk> .
and , if i decided to one step <unk> and on all look , i can do the new <unk> and after my <unk> . here , i have to <unk> ' looking , here , bing , right here to live labs <unk> .
and from here i can go into the side <unk> and again <unk> .
it 's a metaphor , again and used , and every time it makes this picture than the sum of <unk> .
and right now , in this world , we think that 's a curse .
we 're talking about the curse of <unk> .
we talk from `` <unk> in information .
what if we this situation around could and the internet on the head and so that we 'd rather than any of the other to go to start by many things too many things go , and you realize that otherwise 's remained be ?
if we do that can , these <unk> <unk> , maybe a new source <unk> information .
and , instead , just in information to move , we can do it .
and if we do know , then we can perhaps even wisdom that .
so i hear on , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> <unk> science fiction .
in my school i went to the bus to school , every day one hour a way .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> that my mind in different worlds <unk> and on <unk> in my deep in me <unk> , voracious curiosity <unk> .
these curiosity showed up , that i always , when i 'm not in school , through the forests <unk> , went and `` being , collected , frogs and snakes and so , and <unk> , all at home , , and under the microscope at .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was about to be about the trial , the world to understand and the limits of the kinds <unk> .

jacques cousteau came in our living with his fascinating shows that allow us animals and places and a world full of wonder showed that we 've done before they can imagine .
and that will be very good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could draw .
and there 's no video is this <unk> with <unk> movies , all the <unk> in the media , i had the images in my head .
so we had at all , if we as children 's a book read , we took the description of <unk> and <unk> you on the screen in our minds .
my response to that was the record and painting by aliens , alien worlds of robots , <unk> and so what .
in <unk> i was always the teachers get , as i , <unk> <unk> hidden , <unk> .
the creativity to keep it out .
and what happened was something interesting , which brings me out to jacques <unk> shows fascinated , was the idea of us very unfamiliar world here on our planet itself .
certainly would i do n't an alien world with a spaceship , it seemed to me very unlikely .
but there was a world that i actually it could , here on earth , and she was also fascinating and <unk> like all that , what i had always imagined , when i those books read .
so i decided , when i was 15 , <unk> .
the only the problem was , i in a small village in canada , , one 1,000 miles away from the ocean .
it made me but not <unk> .
i <unk> my father , until he finally got a <unk> in <unk> , new york , out of , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i graduated from <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the winter , <unk> , new york .
the ocean , a real ocean , i just two years later to face , when we need to california doing .
since , in the 40 years , by now <unk> , i talked about three , for underwater spent about 500 hours of them in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the sea , even in the <unk> oceans , the realm of <unk> life is how we really hardly anyone can imagine .
and fantasy of nature 's no boundary , in contrast to our own , <unk> human imagination .
until the present day feel the deepest awe of this , what i on my <unk> see .
and my love to the ocean , holding on , with the same intensity of <unk> and the .
when i then as an adult a profession <unk> , it was <unk> .
it seemed to the best way , my inner drive to tell stories to tell , with my need to take pictures to create , to unite .
as a do i always <unk> and so .
so these films the way of images and stories <unk> . that fit together .
it was the stories that i <unk> , from the <unk> , `` terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> .
in `` <unk> '' i was my preference for the <unk> and that come with the <unk> .
so <unk> out of my two passions .
something happened in `` <unk> '' : a <unk> problem in this film to solve -- and that we had such a kind of liquid <unk> create -- that <unk> we have a computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
what they came out that was the first computer-generated <unk> that ever in a film to see .
it took this was n't have a , just as i did he just its <unk> , but i realized something amazing , the audience the world was like <unk> the magic , i went .
and arthur clarke 's law is you know <unk> technology and magic that each of different .
they saw so something magical .
and that i found hugely exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , that has exactly the <unk> involved . ''
so we went into the terminator two , '' my next movie , much .
together with <unk> created this is the types of liquid metal . the success was quite from , like this effect come .
and it worked , again we had something magical created . and the effect in the audience was the same , however , we have to the movie , a bit more money <unk> .
of these experiences and that was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity to <unk> .
so , i a company , together with my good friend <unk> winston , to look at the best <unk> and <unk> , when she was called `` digital <unk> .
the idea of this company , it was that point <unk> processes with <unk> <unk> etc . to skip the same with digital <unk> to start .
so we did then , and <unk> us as a while a <unk> .
but in the '90s , realized we do that we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , actually started had -- to slow <unk> .
i had this piece of the avatar . '' written by the <unk> in the visual effects and <unk> effects in a new heights out , with <unk> human , <unk> characters , using <unk> 's been . and the <unk> should all <unk> , and the world would <unk> .
but the <unk> for quite beautiful , and people in my company told me that we <unk> have n't able to be that .
so then shifted course i and made these other film about the big ship , that <unk> .
the <unk> i have this as `` romeo and juliet on a ship . sells . it was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a passionate film .
secretly , but i wanted to actually the real <unk> the titanic immerse ourselves .
so i have the film .
this is the truth . the studio knew that but not .
i but convinced , and i said , we come to the <unk> , we filming the real <unk> .
we will in the <unk> of the movie .
this is hugely important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> , you an expedition to fund .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to go back to own imagination a reality create .
we created then in six months later a reality , i in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles of the surface of the north atlantic , and the real titanic through a <unk> <unk> .
it was not a film , no <unk> , that was really .
so , that i was really <unk> .
and the up to know , we have cameras and <unk> and all sorts of building .
and i fell on the way of these <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you 're going up in the capsule , <unk> you into this dark , <unk> environment down , where no hope to rescue is , if you do n't even go back to .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's also , as if i in a <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was really obsessed with the study the sea .
so that part of those with curiosity and science to do . it was all . it was an adventure , it was curiosity . it 's imagination .
and it was an experience that to hollywood to be able .
because you know , i could be a creature of to that we then a visual effect design . but i could not so imagine what i outside the <unk> see .
at some of the following <unk> i being in <unk> , and sometimes these things that i have never seen before , sometimes even things that actually do n't seen before , and for the science to the point , and they saw , still do n't know had found .
so i was so right <unk> , and i wanted to be more .
and so , i then a something unusual decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' i said , `` okay , i want to my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood to ice , and i 'm going for a <unk> . ''
and then we started , we <unk> to `` <unk> , '' and <unk> them with <unk> .
we <unk> for <unk> the titanic .
we were little robot that we built , the a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and the inside of <unk> at what 's never before we did was .
nobody had ever seen the inside of <unk> explores , you 'd have no cure for it so , we have to technology .
well , and i am i now , on the <unk> the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> that these <unk> here 's quite similar and of which i know that once the band and performed .
and i fly with a little <unk> through the aisles of <unk> .
i <unk> it 's actually just , but my mind is inside the <unk> .
it felt , as if i physically inside the <unk> the titanic <unk> .
that was the <unk> form of <unk> that i ever experienced , because before i at a corner <unk> , i did n't always on , what the very <unk> of <unk> up , because i months about <unk> did was , when we the film turned .
this <unk> was actually an exact copy of <unk> of <unk> .
so that was an extremely strange .
they made me this <unk> realized that you have such <unk> <unk> use and so that your consciousness in the vehicle , in this different form of existence embarrassed .
it was really been profound
and maybe even a view on this , which may be in a few decades to happen , if you <unk> has to explore or other things to do in all sorts <unk> <unk> that i want me as <unk> can imagine .
after these <unk> we started this is what we down there seen , really appreciate to learn , for those <unk> , where we have this incredible <unk> animals saw . that 's sort of alien , but here on <unk> .
they 're going to help of <unk> .
they are not in the sunlight <unk> system , as we do that .
and so you see animals , the right side of the degrees are you can survive .
the same time was i also very interested in <unk> , that was over the <unk> from my childhood .
and so i ended up at the people in the space in and with the nasa to do , and <unk> sit and right <unk> planning . you drive to russia , through the mission that <unk> <unk> <unk> all drum and off , and then the international <unk> and take our <unk> with .
this was amazing .
but at the ran it on top of that i <unk> with us in the sea , .
i took them with and <unk> you access to the world down there , <unk> , <unk> , people who are for such extreme conditions interested , i took them to the sources of that you look around , being , and instruments testing , and so forth .
we turned it <unk> to run but in science , specifically , <unk> .
this was at the circle of my own existence as <unk> , then as a child , and the <unk> in the reality .
throughout this <unk> i have a lot .
i have a lot of science . but i think they certainly , a director 's also have , a leader be like a <unk> or so .
i understood but not a lot of leadership , before i <unk> <unk> .
because of a certain point i had to tell me , `` what i 'm here ?
why i 'm doing this ? what comes to find ? ''
these <unk> movies and bring us do n't have a .
we 're going to the <unk> a lot of fame not a lane .
all thinking , i was between the titanic '' and `` avatar . <unk> and i would have to go somewhere in the <unk> on a towel the beach <unk> .
i 've all these films , these <unk> , for a very small audience .
no fame , not an honor , no money , which are you just ?
you 're doing it around the task will to the challenge will -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment that there . you 're doing it 's <unk> because , because of the strange connection that comes in a small group of people a team is .
because we have all this with only 10 to 12 people made that for about <unk> , sometimes we were two or three months in at sea .
and in that community you that the most important thing that <unk> is that you to each other , because you a task . has that you see any other explain .
if you on land back and says , `` we had to do it , that <unk> that <unk> , and that all around the whole technology , and the trouble , the human <unk> , if you look at sea works , '' then you can see the other just ca n't explain . this is the police or with soldiers that have been through , and know that they never going to explain .
there 's a connection , a <unk> respect .
so when i back to my next film `` avatar . '' to turn , i tried the same <unk> apply them , which is that you his team respects , in return to respect deserve .
it was the dynamics really changed .
there , i so again with a small team on <unk> <unk> , we turned the avatar . '' with a new technique that it 's been not yet .
hugely exciting .
a <unk> challenge .
and we have to a period of four years of the family .
by changing , my kind of movies , completely .
there were people who said , we could have these <unk> , really good <unk> and on the planet <unk> transport .
for me it was more a <unk> kind of my job to do the process that the result has changed .
so what do we of all the end ?
the lessons we learned ?
i believe , at first place is the curiosity .
it 's the most human quality .
our imagination is a force that even a reality create .
and the <unk> of your team is important than all <unk> this world .
to get a filmmaker , the , `` give me a council , as i 'm like something . ''
and i say , `` <unk> you do n't even a .
and get a different for you . do n't want to myself , we 'll do for yourself , but take risks , you . ''
the nasa 's such a <unk> , `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and the study to fail an alternative , because there guaranteed to a <unk> .

you have to be , these risks to .
this is the idea that i 'm going to on the way to give me . failure is quite an alternative , fear it 's no .
today i 'm going to tell you about energy and climate .
and that 's maybe something , because of my <unk> the foundation mainly about vaccines , and the seeds turns to the things we make and deliver need to the poorest two billion a better life to make .
but energy and climate is extremely important for those people , in fact , even more than for each other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years n't grow . it 's too much or a little bit <unk> . the things are going to change , as it their <unk> environment is not <unk> .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to <unk> .
so , is a climate change awful lot of them .
moreover , the <unk> for you very important .
in fact , that if you just from one thing the cost of could , <unk> would be so far the most effective .
well , the <unk> is about the time , like .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> the industrial revolution , and even in the last century , there was a <unk> case in <unk> and so we refrigerators . <unk> , we can modern materials manufacture and so many things .
so we 're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the world .
but , if we the cost of -- let 's look at the price of its -- make us on a barrier and the barrier depends on carbon .
co2 up the planet and the equation for carbon is actually pretty clear .
they <unk> the <unk> co2 , which the <unk> , and these <unk> has some very negative . effects on the weather and maybe even worse , the <unk> of that the natural ecosystems , such <unk> changes to adapt , and all these systems <unk> .
well , the exact correlation between a <unk> and it <unk> <unk> and where the other consequences are , there 's some <unk> , but not very much .
and there 's safe <unk> about , as bad these are , but they 're very bad be .
i have the <unk> several asked , `` we have really down to close to come ?
does not a half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is until we 're near zero , is the temperature to go up .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a 3.5 feet high truck , under a three feet bridge from . that you can then sort of it was they .
this must be looking down to zero .
well , we are every year of <unk> , of 26 billion tons .
anybody who are about 20 tons of people from the poor countries , less than one .
on average , it 's about tons of every on the planet .
and somehow we have to change can that to zero down .
it 's been constant up .
just for economic changes , it mean by and we need to <unk> rise of reduction , and to a reduction to zero .
that equation , four factors . a little <unk> . you have this thing left -- carbon dioxide -- that you 're moving towards zero to do and that 's the number of people depend on , from the <unk> that every human on average use , the average of energy for each of service and the co2 , per <unk> <unk> .
let 's so every single factor individually at and think we , how we 're going to zero .
probably have one of these numbers very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let 's it through .
so we have the population .
now live 6.8 billion people .
and it is at 9 billion . the to be 9 billion .
if we 're very successful with new <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> are we could that i think about 10 percent by 15 percent down , but right now let 's a slope to 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
that includes all the food that we eat , clothing , television , <unk> .
these are very good things and <unk> means that those services , almost every on the planet accessible .
it 's great that this number up .
in the world , in the top billion , we could be <unk> , and less use , but on average is that number of every year , and so there more than double , the number of services , per person who are .
we 're a very basic service . there , light , so the homework can read ?
and those students did n't it , so you go out and reading your <unk> under the <unk> .
now , at -- , the e , the energy per service , there are finally good news .
we have something that not going up .
because of success in <unk> , by other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there 's a lot of services , whose <unk> some of services let 's about 90 percent .
in other <unk> , like the manufacturing of <unk> , 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the <unk> for is very much smaller .
there , if we optimistic , we might be a <unk> about a factor of three or maybe even a factor of six .
but the first three factors that we are now of 26 billion to be <unk> 13 billion tons . and that 's just do n't look !
so let 's the fourth factor of -- and this is a <unk> be -- that is the amount of co2 , per <unk> <unk> .
it turns out the question , if you do it up to get it .
and coal burning , no .
if you natural gas burning , no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> the co2 , except for those renewables and <unk> .
so , what we 're on a global level to have , is a new system .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` wonders , use , i do n't the impossible .
the <unk> is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and of services is a miracle .
the people have here at the development of this miracle contributed .
and there 's no <unk> that you have a miracle to a date needs .
and then you basically just wrong and some people come to others .
in this case , we but <unk> , and a miracle , very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i really <unk> ?
there 's a natural <unk> , a demonstration of the idea of people here <unk> ?
i was reminded me of last year , when i mosquitos , and somehow liked the people that .
the idea was for you really tangible , you know that there are people are , by mosquitos .
for energy , i noticed this one .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies my <unk> contribution to the environment is what would be .
here are so some natural fireflies .
you 've got me that you to do n't bite . actually you 'll probably not even the glass of .
now , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they bring all not much .
we need solutions , either one or a lot of an incredible scaling up and almost unimaginable <unk> , and so many ways , where people and look , i really just five of these big needs can afford .
i <unk> , <unk> , fusion and <unk> left out .
this could afford to be a <unk> contribution and if you better do when i expect , that would be great , but it 's here is that we looked at all those five to have , and we ca n't of them up , because they 're <unk> , because all have significant problems .
let 's look at the burning <unk> fuels , <unk> of either coal or gas .
so what you can do have to it seems to be easy , but it 's not . you have all the co2 , after the burning of the <unk> comes to capture , under pressure <unk> and then there somewhere camps and hope that there are .
there are some <unk> that , 60 percent -- 80 percent to create , but it on 100 percent to get it 's very difficult , and a <unk> for the <unk> of co2 to get that 's a big challenge , but the biggest problem is the <unk> .
and it 's going to make sure ?
who can see something guarantee that 's literally a billion times bigger than any kind of junk that you come from <unk> and other things can imagine ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that 's a tough <unk> .
the next thing : <unk> .
and also has three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries are , the question for certainty that you really feel that nothing wrong way , despite the human <unk> that the fuel not for weapons are used .
and what makes you with the garbage ?
because even though he did n't very large is , there 's a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that maybe soluble , and to you that work .
the last three of five years i up .
it 's the renewables , as you often be called .
and also the have -- although it 's awesome is you any fuel need -- they have some <unk> .
for one is the <unk> that these technologies create dramatic lower than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you 're talking of many <unk> a thousand times more area as a normal power station .
moreover <unk> these vents <unk> .
the sun 's not all the day , it 's also not every day and as <unk> also the wind n't always .
so you have , if you about these data on , a way , the energy , in times when they 're not available , .
there 's so large <unk> . there 's the challenges in the of course , if we for say that <unk> outside of the country , they need not just the technology , they also need to the risk around that the energy from where they came from .
and there is that <unk> .
and the dimension to show , i 've all kinds of batteries , which made , looking at : the of cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for anything , and i looked at the amount of electronic energy , which the world uses , compared to , i found that all the batteries , we produce , less than 10 minutes of <unk> camps .
we need so here 's a breakthrough , something that i think about a factor to be better , when the <unk> right now .
this is not impossible , but it 's not so easily .
this happens when you 're trying to <unk> sources of saying we 20 percent -- 30 percent of <unk> to .
if you about 100 percent of it <unk> , they need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go , what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project . '' ? how we come to target ?
what we need are many companies that 's work with hundreds of .
in any of five and we need at least 100 people .
so thank you will say , they 're crazy ! that 's good .
i believe , here in the ted , there are many , there are engaged .
bill by one of companies , among other one called <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of companies in the great things , and interesting ways , and i try this to support .
nathan <unk> and i pay for a company that , may surprise , the nuclear approach tracked .
there are some of the <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> .
the development , in this industry in a stopped , so it 's no big surprise that some good ideas <unk> .
this <unk> means that you rather than one part of <unk> , the one percent of the <unk> , we decided that 99 percent of burning , that <unk> .
this is a kind of a crazy idea .
but actually did you about it has been thinking , but you could never <unk> simulate , whether it would work , but since the modern supercomputer , do you 're and see that : aye . with the right <unk> , , it looks that it <unk> .
and because you 99 percent of burning , is <unk> very much better .
actually burning to waste , and you can even the waste of thousands of them up as <unk> use .
instead of about the head to break , burn it , an amazing thing .
this uranium is <unk> used to a little bit like a <unk> .
you see that there 's a column , often as `` <unk> wave reactor , as .
it will really the <unk> .
here 's an image of <unk> in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part of today down , <unk> so does it <unk> uranium .
this <unk> the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you <unk> cheap and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of lifetime of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward .
think we , as we take our success measure .
how to our old testament to look like ?
now , we go up to the goal , that we do need and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
so a talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it 's really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent to poor countries is going , still a agriculture , hopefully will <unk> and <unk> until then clean .
so , to these 80 percent to have the developed world , including countries like china , their <unk> completely <unk> .
the other note , whether we <unk> technology to use , if you in all the developed countries in fact , and we 're going on the way , you to the rest .
it 's great .
this is a key that <unk> .
if we from there to go back , how would that by 2020 testament to look like ?
it should be the two elements of .
we should be the <unk> use to reduction on the way to , the less than we <unk> , the lower the <unk> , and also the temperature .
but actually is this note to the things that we do that do n't fully to the big <unk> , just right , or even a bit less important as the other that <unk> of innovation for these breakthroughs .
these breakthroughs we need to <unk> track and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are a great books in this topic .
that al gore 's book `` you have the election , and david <unk> `` <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> air . ''
they go there really , and create a framework , where this broad discussed can be , because we need to support of all sides .
there are some things that come together .
this is a wish .
a very <unk> wish that we do this technology invent .
if you see me just a desire for the next 50 years <unk> , i could the president choose to <unk> , and i love , i could get this desire for that says , <unk> <unk> no carbon being invented . this desire <unk> i .
this has the effect .
so this desire to get that 's going to dig a long and <unk> <unk> people awful , between the u.s. and china , between the poor and rich countries , and almost all life of these two billion are very much worse .
what do we do ?
for the action <unk> me ?
and we have for more funding .
if countries in places like <unk> , they should not just about co2 .
you should those <unk> to and they were shocked by the ridiculous low <unk> , for that cutting-edge <unk> on .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> & trade something that a <unk> does .
we have the news .
we must have <unk> and <unk> lead and also the things from the government done .
it 's an important wish , but i think we 're able to fulfill .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you !
thank you just about <unk> something better to understand -- first , you can tell us an idea of scale of investment be ?
bill gates , the simulation in a supercomputer to , all great scientist , what we 've done , we need to just some 10 million dollars , and even if we our materials in a russian reactor tested have to that there <unk> works , you only in the <unk> million .
the tough step is the building the first <unk> , another billion to find that <unk> and the place of in the first of building .
once the first done is if he 's walking like i promised , it 's all very clear , because the <unk> that <unk> is so different than at <unk> , as we know it .
the right to understand : that means a deep in the floor to almost like a vertical pillar nuclear <unk> , that were <unk> and then , the process up and working to keep going down ?
bg : exactly . what they have to the reactor , new <unk> , so there are many people and many <unk> , the wrong way . this thing where you get it opens and things <unk> or <unk> . that 's not great !
but if you very cheap fuel , you can get it for 60 years <unk> -- think about a column -- that you 've been buried , without the whole <unk> .
and it 's sitting there and <unk> 60 years long and then it 's done .
a <unk> , even a solution to the garbage is .
bg : yeah , well , what about the garbage is : you can sit in -- there are much less junk with this method -- then take them and put him in the reactor and burn it on .
and we start , and by the garbage , the already exists , in these <unk> or <unk> of them up . this is our <unk> .
so it 's what , for these reactors run a problem was that , what we in our fill and this is that <unk> dramatically reduce during this process .
but while you with different people of the world of these opportunities 've talked about ,
where is the interest , so what really want to ?
bg : so we have n't on a place <unk> and it 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is , there are big interest and the people of the company was in russia , india , china -- i was here and have the <unk> met and talked about , like this to <unk> fit .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction .
this is a variation and one thing that was done .
this is a more step forward , but it 's like a faster reactor and some countries have these are built , which is anyone who 's a rapid reactor implemented , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , <unk> and probability that really in order to call out ?
bg : so we need one of <unk> , <unk> things that very cheap , we have 20 years to make and then 20 years to use .
this is like the <unk> that look at the <unk> with , that we <unk> .
and you know , <unk> , if all walks , and it 's a desire to be the easy .
and fortunately , there 's dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of , as well , if their <unk> work , the <unk> for the pilot works , for <unk> .
and it would be the best , if it several create , because then you could a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
<unk> of the kinds breakthroughs , this is the world that you know ?
bg : a <unk> is the <unk> .
so it would be without the <unk> been , but that makes it 's so much more important .
in a nuclear sector , there are some innovative companies .
you know , we know their work not as well as this , but there 's the <unk> way , this is a different approach .
there 's a fluid <unk> , which is something hard , but you might say that 's about us .
and so there are different , but the nice thing is that a <unk> a million times as much energy , like a , say , a <unk> and so , if you with the problems deal , and they are mostly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , in a own <unk> .
if it does n't know , what ?
we have <unk> <unk> to try to the <unk> stable enough to be ?
bg : if you in this situation , it 's as if you too much eating , and shortly before a heart attack . what makes you do you might be a <unk> or anything like .
there 's a <unk> that <unk> is that with various techniques <unk> to the global warming , <unk> that we 20 or 30 years longer just about us <unk> .
this is just one <unk> .
i hope that we do n't need .
some people say , you should n't believe in the insurance , because that may be lazy does that you to eat , because you know that one of the <unk> save .
i do n't know that that smart , if you look at the importance of this problem of eyes , but there are now a <unk> in <unk> about , if you at have , if the things faster , or this innovation longer need , when we expect .
climate , you have one or two sentences for the to be able to convince them ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics in very different <unk> .
the ones who scientific arguments that , are very little bit .
they say that there are negative impact is that with the clouds to do , the things to move ?
there are very , very few things that you ever say , of which it a chance in a million .
this <unk> is something like the aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for this very much later .
and that 's the idea , now , if you all kinds of <unk> problems , in something to invest in that you do n't until later , which has -- and this is that the investment not so clearly , who is actually is the <unk> report n't necessarily the worst scenario , and there 's people in the rich world , <unk> at and say , okay , that 's not a big drama .
the fact is that this kind of us to do .
but my dream is that if you economic can do , and at the co2 cleaned up , then also say the skeptics , `` okay , it does n't get me that there 's no carbon <unk> , i wish , that it did , but i 'm it would accept , because it 's cheaper , when the previous one . ''
and that would be your answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that if you all the time and energy use the co2 problem to solve , all the other goals and suffering , the <unk> that <unk> of malaria and so that there 's a dumb waste of resources , money for it to invest , while it better stuff is that we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending for the research -- let 's the u.s. , 10 billion per year to spend when they do today -- that is not so dramatically .
it should be other things do n't suffer .
you then the big <unk> , and you can make reasonable people <unk> , if you something , that no economic , and tried to this to fund , for me is happening here of the waste .
it 's because it 's very shortly before a <unk> and funded by just have the learning curve . i think we should be more things are trying to the potential , very much cheaper .
if the <unk> that you know , a very high <unk> , can only the rich up .
i mean , each of us here , five times as much for our energy on without your lifestyle .
for the bottom two billion but it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> think about .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research that <unk> ? ''
he 's still , because of his early stories , with the <unk> associated , but he understood that this is a very lonely group is and therefore , he now this <unk> .
and this is a <unk> that i thought , to think .
the research , it 's crazy , how little , who will .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope that their desire true . thank you .
bg : thanks .
a few years ago , here at ted , , peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> have to <unk> <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about . <unk> tape , about . <unk> thread , and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow have on top .
and , although it really easy , it 's actually really hard , because it 's people <unk> very quickly work together .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea is and i put it into a <unk> into .
it was a huge success .
since i talked about 70 workshops world 's done , with students , <unk> and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there is something about this task , what 's <unk> in the nature of cooperation is and i want some of share with you .
usually the most people yourself in the task to orient .
they talk about , you think , as it will look , they <unk> to do .
and invest in a little time in planning and organization . they <unk> and put <unk> .
they invest in a large part of time in the <unk> constantly <unk> structures
and finally , just before they do n't have time to have to take someone the marshmallow and they put him gently down on the peak , step one step back and `` <unk> '' to admire them their work .
but then , almost always , is that the `` <unk> '' to a `` <unk> '' will , because the weight of <unk> <unk> that the whole thing to <unk> and <unk> .
there 's a series of people much more `` <unk> '' <unk> have than others , and the worst , fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they <unk> , they 're confused and make really <unk> shapes .
and , there 's also teams who are much more `` <unk> '' <unk> , and the best , fresh alumni of <unk> .
and it 's pretty amazing .
how we peter told make them not just the highest towers , but the most of all .
what you might ask , is : how does this ? why ? what about them ?
and peter told , none of children spend time in it was the <unk> <unk> to be .
they are no time in <unk> .
but there 's another one another reason .
and that that <unk> trained , the one right plan to find , ok .
and then to realize .
then what happens when you the marshmallow on the top of put , they have no time , and what happened ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what <unk> they do is you with the marshmallow start and prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the so that they <unk> to have <unk> prototypes to fix .
<unk> recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of <unk> <unk> .
and with every attempt get the children directly feedback what works and what do n't .
this is the performance of prototypes to work , much -- but we see , how different teams operate .
the average for the most is about . <unk> , <unk> create a half of lawyers something more , but not a lot of <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the most ?
architect and engineers , for happiness .
<unk> is the ultimate , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they triangles understand and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build a structure .
ceos are about the average , but here 's interesting .
of you take a <unk> <unk> on the team , you are significantly more .
it 's unbelievable . you look around and see `` this team is going to win . ''
you can see the predictions . why is that ?
because they particular skills of <unk> .
they run the process , they understand him .
and this team that <unk> and on the work <unk> is the performance of the team significant .
<unk> skills and <unk> and the combination lead to succeed .
if you 10 teams , the typical approach to get you ca : six to build a structure .
i was now let 's exciting .
i thought , bring the <unk> equal .
so provided i got a <unk> $ price of software for the winner .
what you think this happened with these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a robust structure .
and so a <unk> of construction built , he had the price home , worn .
it 's not interesting that high <unk> a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the students .
what do you happening now ?
well understood the advantage of `` <unk> .
so , from the same , bad team of the best .
they produced the construction in the <unk> time .
there are so <unk> lessons for us , over the nature of machine and success .
you might ask : why would someone in time to invest in a <unk> to create ?
the reason is , i 'll help digital tools and processes to to teams to help , cars , video games and `` <unk> <unk> '' to create .
and <unk> does is , it helps them to assumptions to identify .
because frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language , . <unk> , the prototype .
and this is the value of experience , this as simple exercise .
and those of them , it does that can <unk> visit .
it 's a blog , where you see how to the <unk> building .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find a crazy examples from earth , how people the system optimize and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i believe is that construction in a <unk> sports .
it does that we all our sense of the task turn and that we think can use of our feelings and we do , in the challenge , the front of us .
and sometimes it is a small prototype this experience anything that it needs to us from a `` <unk> '' -- a `` <unk> '' moment to .
and that can a big difference .
thank you .
we do such as we would have here a machine .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a time .
and everybody in this room to get inside .
and you can go into the past , you can go to the future go ; they can not in here and now to stay .
and i wonder what you choose , because i was my friends in the last time to this question is , and they did all in the past .
i do n't know , they wanted to the time , before it cars , or twitter or `` america in the <unk> .
i do n't .
i 'm convinced that you 've got to nostalgia , to <unk> with .
and that i .
i 'm not part of this group , i have to say .
i do n't want to the past , and it , because i was a <unk> am .
it that 's because of on the planet n't go back , you go forward .
i do so in this machine , and i want to the future .
this is the greatest time , it ever been on the planet , anyway , what scale , they make , health , kind of mobility , opportunities for a declining <unk> .
there was never before a time as this .
my <unk> , and when she turned .
my grandparents <unk> that number of 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
there was so it 's a nine the beginning of my <unk> .
but it 's not just about people like us , because this is a greater thing than that .
a kid , that today in delhi born , can expect , so long to live as the richest man on the 100 years ago .
think about it . it 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
that smallpox . that smallpox , billion people on the planet killed .
they have the demographics the ground in a way to shaped , as it 's no war has ever done .
they 've gone . they are gone .
we have you <unk> . <unk> .
in the world are diseases , the millions of us to just one generation , threatened , not yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
do anything else 's what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to billion people to feed , that 's success of scientific method .
and in my view is the scientific method of things out , look , whether it works , it can change , if it 's not doing , one of of achievements of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately it 's been around the good news , because there 's some other problems , and they were often said ,
and one of this is , despite all of our of a billion people in this world every day for the bed .
this number up , and she goes up very , and that is <unk> .
and not only that , we have our ability to be used to the world do to <unk> .
water , <unk> country , rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , and that soon , and if we 're not from this chaos <unk> disappearing , we .
so the question is : we can do that ? i think about .
i think it 's clear that we food can produce , the billion people feed , without the country , they 're going to <unk> .
i think we can see this world with energy to that you do n't look at destroyed .
i think that really , and no , this is n't <unk> .
but here it keeps me at up -- one of things that me at awake , we have scientific advance have never been so desperately needed to face now , have never ,
and we were also have never to him <unk> <unk> , as we have today .
we 're at the verge of amazing , amazing events in many places , and yet i really that we are hundreds of 300 years ago the enlightenment go back to to a time to find in which we , fought , in the we think about these things <unk> <unk> , and more <unk> and now .
so people <unk> in their faith , and that this is that you 're not free .
not even the truth will you free .
and listen to , everybody has a right on his mind , even a right on his mind to the progress .
but you know , where they do n't be right ?
they have no right on their own facts . <unk> , they do n't .
and i got a while needed to this out .
about a decade , i an article about <unk> for `` the new yorker , '' written , a little paper .
and i was amazed that in opposition to go into of resistance towards the , what the end of the most activity in public health in history of humanity .
i did n't know , what i should do , so i did n't know what i always do , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon after that i wrote an article about <unk> changed my food .
the same thing , only bigger .
so people were crazy .
so i also about an article written , and i could n't understand why the people thought that would be `` <unk> , why they believed that molecule in a certain of a random kind <unk> a <unk> on the area of nature .
but you know , i 'm doing what i do . i wrote the articles , i went on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we <unk> , we pass a , we eat out , that 's okay .
but these articles were to worry , and i could n't want to figure out why , and finally , i found it turns out .
and that 's because these <unk> that makes me nuts were actually not <unk> .
these were <unk> people , educated people , a decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and it took me the clutter ...
but then i thought , you know what , let 's face .
we 're at some point gotten that we 're not the same relationship to advance , how it .
we 're <unk> of them .
we 're ironic that , with small <unk> about , `` progress .
okay , for that there are , and i think we know , what kind of these are .
we have the confidence in institutions , authority , and sometimes in the science , lost , and it 's no reason that 's not that .
you can just a name is and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> that <unk> , <unk> of mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can take your list vote .
there are questions and problems with the people , of which we believed that they 're always right . are they 're skeptical .
imagine you ask , for them the evidence , for you evidence .
let 's nothing more than any given us down .
but this is it , if you see evidence do you have this evidence suppose , and there are we 're not good .
and i can it out of the reason that 's now in an epidemic of fear life , as i want you have never seen , and hopefully not going to see .
about 12 years ago was a story published , a horrific story that <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in the got .
very <unk> .
<unk> studies have been done to see if that was true .
<unk> studies have done to deal ; it 's a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all right , no correlation , not a connection , not .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter , because we thought of anecdotes , we believe that we see , what we want to see , what <unk> that we really feel .
we do n't think about a <unk> documents from a <unk> that allows us data , and i understand that , i think that do we all .
but you know what ?
the result of it was <unk> .
<unk> because of fact , the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world , where the immunization for <unk> down .
this is <unk> and we should be ashamed .
it 's awful .
what happened that we do that .
now , i understand that . that i do .
because it 's someone <unk> ?
has one in the audience ever want one of <unk> die ?
does n't very often .
what happens in this country do n't know , but <unk> time in the world in the last year .
these are many deaths from <unk> , 20 percent per hour .
but because it 's what happened , we can see this crowd , and people like <unk> <unk> can be the messages of fear and <unk> of platforms such as oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and correlation not connecting .
they do n't that these things going to be really , but almost never the same .
and this is something that we learn to , and it 's very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
not afraid , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , gone .
the guy in the not so much .
he does paul <unk> .
he 's just with a few other people a <unk> .
he can see the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty well , right ?
now , this is good , except that paul <unk> and over vaccines talks and says , how valuable they are , and that people just stop them to <unk> .
and that says he actually this .
paul 's a <unk> .
if paul in a public <unk> , he can not without armed <unk> statements .
he 's taking at home , because the people him to tell you know where his kids to school .
and why ? because paul a <unk> did .
i do n't that say , but vaccines are essential .
you take it continues to return of heart disease , terrible disease , and that happens right .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and it gets worse , and pretty soon be children back to die , because it 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just to <unk> die .
what about <unk> ? so that . why not ?
a <unk> of me was a few weeks , and told you think i 'm a little too <unk> .
nobody has it ever said .
they were to your child 's not against <unk> <unk> , there is no way .
<unk> .
why ? because we do n't <unk> , and you know what ?
we had in this country i do n't <unk> .
today , i do n't know , maybe we got this morning somebody in lagos in a plane and fly straight to los angeles , right now , he of ohio .
and in a few hours of it and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> today i go .
and he does n't know that he 's a <unk> disease infected , and we know that 's not , because that 's the world as well .
this is the planet , we live . they do n't so , as if he did n't that is .
we love it , to lie to <unk> , we love this .
they have this morning all your vitamins , ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that you on the <unk> helps .
i know that they do that , because half the americans , every day .
they take the stuff , and you take an <unk> , and it does n't matter , how often we find that they 're useless .
the data <unk> the time .
they <unk> their urine . do more you almost never .
that 's okay , they want to 28 billion dollars for a dark urine .
i agree to completely .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do why do we do
now , i believe , i understand -- we hate the industry .
we hate it too strong government , we did n't trust the system .
and that we should also have our health is <unk> .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> to us that it can afford .
we 're so before that way , and where do we ?
we walk into the poor the <unk> .
it 's great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , it 's really a serious business , because the stuff is crap , and we give billion dollars for it .
and i 've all kinds of artifacts .
n't know about -- <unk> , was , <unk> , was , <unk> , because i know it 's what that is , but we give billion dollars for it , it was .
and you know what ? if i say , screaming , the people , and say , `` what does it up ? let people , but we do that you want .
so you feel a good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because i was no matter is , whether it the minister , who says , `` hmm , i 'm going to the evidence of experts to mammography does n't suppose '' or any <unk> , his patients with <unk> treat .
if you look at this way you 're , where i think , and the magic of evidence and science 're going to get them to a place that they do n't want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he was 400,000 of people around , because he it was that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more than any antiretroviral drugs , of which we know that it the course of aids braking .
hundreds of <unk> deaths in a country that gets worse than any other of this disease <unk> .
they say i 'm not that these things have consequences .
and they 're going to do you have always .
now , the <unk> epidemic in which we just find that is this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> <unk> <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , the metaphor .
this ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , everyone <unk> , by the people changed .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we all this .
we have it in the last <unk> years .
and some of it has worked and some .
we 're sort of , what do n't work .
now we can you look , and , there are risks , but we can see something like vitamin a lot of rice do , and the stuff can million people to help , million people , your life to <unk> .
it would you ca n't do ?
i must say that i do n't .
we <unk> <unk> changed my food .
why do we do this ?
well , what i just hear is , too many of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't have a huge areas of thing that 's wrong .
we do n't know that companies are patent .
we do n't know that companies seeds have .
and you know what my response to all this is ?
yes , they have right . <unk> we that .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but this is not science .
this did with science has nothing to do .
it 's right , moral , <unk> .
you know that is not a company .
it 's no country .
it 's not just an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it does he and sometimes not , but the idea that we of science not allow them , their work to do , because we fear is a real <unk> , and it 's millions of people from <unk> .
you know , in the next 50 years , we get 70 percent more to grow to the right now , 70 percent .
and investment in africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
they do this , and we give you do n't .
and why ? <unk> changed my food .
we want people to encourage , this <unk> stuff to eat , for example <unk> .
<unk> is something that half a billion people eat .
it 's about how a potato .
it 's just a <unk> calories . it 's <unk> .
it did n't require nutrients , it 's not a protein , and scientists are all the right at a .
and then they could make people are the food and would be blind .
they would n't starving , and you know what ?
that would you . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would you .
and everything that i want to say , is : why fight us that ?
i mean , we ask ourselves : why fight us that ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about the genes <unk> . it 's not about these chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> on more food , better food , <unk> food .
it 's not a rice <unk> , it 's about people in life , and it 's highest time , to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do , and so forth , how to do we take a little bit guilty that we , i do n't feel guilty want to be , high-tech , .
there 's no other description for this , what happens .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it is not <unk> , and we need to the really stop .
after this incredible fun having to you might say , you still in this ridiculous time and in the future go ? ''
anyway , and so let me , .
and right now , you in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can see this time on all to imagine what we want .
we can you <unk> , where we 're <unk> , and we 're going to move , where we want .
we have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we 're in the time , and in the future , we 'll be happy to do that .
i know that we can , and as it to focus on this is something that 's the world now needs .
thank you .
thank you .
for a interested , for the <unk> . it may of appear to be a magician for it does it was because , you look at it , as i , `` a deception , to something real , if someone just stuck with enough to believe . ''
in other words , <unk> have in some research has a <unk> be shown that <unk> , and it 's just so , because the person who thinks that with her going to be a <unk> or a kind of -- in <unk> , there , if the patient 's just stuck with enough to believe , a <unk> effect on the body that you see the <unk> .
a delusion is going to something real , because somebody it 's about .
so we 're also , i want to now a fundamental , very simple <unk> .
and i 'm going to show how he works . this is a trick , the least for the 1950s in every <unk> for children .
i even have him from <unk> <unk> magic of <unk> in the 1970s .
i 'm going to him for them out and then .
and then i 'll explain why do i want to me .
so , you see , what happens .
the knife , that you look at can ; my hand , which they do .
i 'm going to the knife just so in my <unk> .
i <unk> my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve away , or from him out , i 'm going to my wrist right here <unk> .
in this way you can see that at any time anything . as i <unk> , nothing in my sleeve , or out .
and the goal is very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if all going to the knife by my <unk> physical <unk> <unk> .
it 's sitting in fact that stuck in its place that i shake it , without the knife <unk> .
it goes into my sleeve , coming out , no <unk> , and you can all to study .
<unk> .
now , this is a trick that i often very young kids <unk> , for magic interested , because you can make a very much about deception learn , if you look <unk> , although it a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably know many of them in this room the trick .
he this is the way .
i think that knife in my hand .
i say that i had my wrist <unk> to that nothing in my sleeve does n't come out , and that is a lie .
the reason why i spent my wrist <unk> , is that at the real secret of the illusion of .
the moment , where i mean by hand of you <unk> that they 're from the back to see is one finger , my <unk> , just from there , where he was , in a position in which he 's <unk> .
wonderful trick ?
because the back and someone who 's not a childhood .
so , he 's here . right .
and when i <unk> , changing the finger at its position .
and now you could talk about , why it a deception , why do n't think about that down here just three fingers to see are , because the mind and the way that he information of , they do individually counts , one , two , three , but it as a group .
but that 's now here actually not . and open and my hand .
so it will be there <unk> , but not by the <unk> my body , but by a trick , through my <unk> , the right now , there is .
and if i mean , close to the same thing , i <unk> , through this is behind that the finger , again <unk> .
i assume that one hand , and there is the knife .
the trick , they can your friends and your <unk> .
now , which has the <unk> to do ?
a year , i was a study that i really <unk> .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and so , for me an amazing thing .
it is what turned out : if you a <unk> in the form of the pill offer in the form of <unk> , is just a round , white pill , a <unk> effect .
but if you the shape , in the <unk> <unk> , for them in a smaller pill change , and this blue <unk> and a letter to that <unk> , it is actually measurable more effective .
and that , none of any <unk> -- it is just <unk> .
but a white ball is not as well as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really out .
well it but that it 's not everything is .
if you <unk> , are still more than <unk> every form .
a colored capsule , in one of the yellow and the other red , is better than a white capsule .
the <unk> plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as well as three pills -- and i ca now not to the exact statistic . i 'm sorry .
the critical but is ...
... that the <unk> play a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you have the ultimate <unk> have to you have to the needle reach .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance that you a patient <unk> .
it creates a very powerful image in mind . that 's very much more than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to them to another time , if we have a <unk> .
fact , is that the white pill not so good is how the blue pill , not so good is like a time capsule , not so good is how the needle .
and none of has some really <unk> property . it 's only we think of the in us a stronger kind with .
i want to know if i this idea for a <unk> use .
i take something that 's a deception , and let 's really look .
we know , from the study that you have to the needle reach to , if it to the thing to go .
this is a 18 two long <unk> . it 's very , <unk> , and i 'm going to the first of a little bit <unk> .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is n't <unk> of hollywood .
i 'm going to this needle in my skin bite and by making them , , until you on the other hand , <unk> .
if you <unk> is -- if you can easily in <unk> fall -- i did that 's some friends last night in the hotel <unk> , and some people that i do n't know , and that 's a woman 's almost <unk> .
i 'm so , if you very <unk> , then you look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i 'm going to the first <unk> part here back .
you can see it 'll see , you can but also <unk> , if you want .
so , it 's so , right here , where my flesh to start to the bottom of my <unk> i 'm just a little <unk> .
i 'm really sorry . makes them the crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and on the other way back out .
now we 're actually in the situation that we have to <unk> .
about .
but now you can my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , i 'm going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know what the people think , if you see .
they say , okay , who 's certainly not so stupid , and <unk> to the skin , just to us a few minutes long time to talk . ''
now , then i 'm going to show you .
what about this look pretty good .
now , i know .
and people back , `` okay , i do n't seen . ''
so people in the <unk> come from now in .
so it to get out and show .
this is really my skin . this is n't <unk> of hollywood .
it 's my meat , and i can it <unk> .
i 'm sorry , if you <unk> going to take a way , and not going down .
so people back or the that later , at once a video that will say , `` well , this is what 's fairly impressive , but if it really , he 's -- you see here 's a hole and there , if it 's really , it would <unk> . ''
okay , let me some blood for you <unk> .
yes , here is it .
and i 'd like now the needle <unk> .

but i think , in that frame , and so with intent , from a deception a real , i 'm going to the needle just in there , and so from the stage .
we 're going to the next few days a couple of all face .
i hope you look forward to have to that . thanks .
everybody talks today about the lucky .
i have some people the number of books are now , by `` <unk> '' in the title of the last five years out , and they gave after about 40 , and there was more .
there 's a massive wave of <unk> of happiness , researchers .
there are very much <unk> .
everybody would like to people are happier .
but despite all of flood of work , there 's a cognitive fall , it sort of almost impossible to be clear about happiness .
and my talk today is a lot of these cognitive 're doing .
this is true for <unk> , about their own happiness think , and it with scientists , they 're lucky to think , because it turns out that we just as clutter , like everyone else .
the first of falling is a <unk> , complexity admitting this .
it turns out that the word , just a useful word that is , because we do it 's too many different things to .
i think there 's a particular meaning , on the way we <unk> could , and by and this is something that we give up to be , and we 're going to the complicated view on need to talk about comfort .
the case is a <unk> of experience and memory , basically what is made them between be happy in his life and be happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the <unk> fact that we 're not about a fact can think , the well-being that , without its importance to warp .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there is simply no way to get it down .
now i 'd like to an example start from someone who 's a <unk> had to one of lectures , a story was . [ unclear ... '' ] he said , he had a symphony heard , and it was absolutely <unk> music , and it at the shot , there was a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then put it 's going to add , really quite emotionally , that has the whole experience ruined .
but it did n't it .
what it ruined had been the memories of the experience .
he had the experience had .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
they <unk> not because it with a memory <unk> was , the memory was ruined , and the memory , everything that he went to keep getting .
what 's the really does this is that we think about us and about other people think that the sense of two types of themselves .
there 's a <unk> itself , that in the present lives and the present know , capable of the back to experience , and basically just the present .
it 's the <unk> itself , that the doctor <unk> -- you know if the doctor says , `` it going to hurt , i look at this <unk> ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> itself , and that <unk> itself is that <unk> and the story of maintain get , and it 's <unk> that the doctor <unk> and the question is , `` how do you have the last time to feel ? ''
or `` what was their journey in albania , or something like .
these are two very different entities that <unk> themselves and that <unk> itself , and the two to <unk> 's part of the <unk> of <unk> of happiness .
now , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and this is really a basic reaction to our memories of -- it begins immediately .
we tell you 're not only tell stories , if we 're going to make the stories to tell .
our memory tells us stories , so , what we of our <unk> 're allowed to is a story .
and let <unk> with an example start .
there 's an old study .
these are real patient , a painful <unk> <unk> .
i 'm not going into detail . it is today 's no more painful , but she was painful , when this study in the 1990s done .
they were asked to all of 60 seconds of their pain to report .
and these are two patients . that 's your records .
and they 're wondering , `` who of both have more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient b 's clearly have suffered . his <unk> was no , and every minute of pain , the patient a had had a patient b , and more .
but now there 's another question : `` how much thought that these patients that they <unk> ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient as a lot <unk> <unk> to the <unk> had a patient b .

and none of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but one of them is this clear .
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the worse , it was the , where the pain of the end up its peak , it 's a bad history .
how do we
because we have these people to their <unk> asked , and too much later , `` how bad , the whole thing collectively , `` well ,
and she was much worse for a as a b in the <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> yourself and the <unk> itself .
of view of <unk> itself , b clearly a <unk> time .
well , what you with the patient to make you could , and we have in clinical experiments done , and it 's done , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of patient a <unk> showing you just the <unk> there 's not too much about him to <unk> .
it 's going to lead to the patient suffering from , but just a little bit and much less than before .
and if you a few minutes for power , you <unk> that the <unk> themselves from the patient a bad this is and you have <unk> that the <unk> themselves from the patient a much better off , because now , you patient as a better story about his experience .
and draw a story from ?
and this is true for the stories that the memory that provides and it 's also for the stories that we invent .
which is a story <unk> are <unk> , great moments and end .
end are very , very important and in this case <unk> the end .
now , that <unk> itself is his life continuously .
it has moments of <unk> , one after the other .
and they say , what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really easy . they 're going to be lost .
i mean , the most moments of life -- and i did that how -- you know , the psychological present same as about three seconds long , which means , you know that it in a living in about 600 million of it 's . in a month , there 's about 600,000 , of you leave a lane .
most of you 're completely ignored by <unk> itself .
and yet you get kind of the sense that they count , that whatever while those moments of <unk> going on our lives .
it 's the limited resource that we use as we 're in this world .
and what they are going to be important , but this is not a story that <unk> even for us you .
so we have the <unk> themselves and that <unk> itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the with time .
of view of <unk> itself , if you a vacation , and the second one week that 's good as the first , it 's the <unk> vacation twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
this is not at the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation little bit better than the <unk> vacation , because there 's no new memories added .
they have the story does n't changed .
and in this way is time in the critical variable that a <unk> themselves from a <unk> itself . time has very profound impact on this story .
now , that <unk> itself is more , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's actually <unk> , the decisions hits , because if you a patient , the , say , <unk> at two different surgeons , and to decide , which he would choose to , it 's the , the votes in the memory , the less bad , and this is the surgeon who chose to be .
this <unk> itself has no voice in that choice .
actually do n't we between <unk> , we choose between the memories of experiences .
and even if we looked at the future thinking , we think about our future , usually not a personal experiences .
we think about our future , as <unk> memories .
and basically what can you look , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> itself , and you can see the <unk> even think more than one , this kind of the <unk> itself <unk> of experiences that <unk> to do n't need .
i have the sense that if we vacation do this very often the case , so , we do vacation largely the services of <unk> itself .
and that 's a bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much <unk> we of our memories ?
this is one of explanations that for the dominance of <unk> are empowered .
and if i think about , i think about a vacation that we a few years in antarctica 've done , clearly the vacation was that i ever had , and i think quite often about the ratio , how often i believe in other <unk> think .
and i 've probably from my memory of these <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes for the last four years <unk> .
now , when i ever since the folder open have to 600 , and i would have another one hour spent .
now , that are three weeks , and these are <unk> a few hours .
because it seems a <unk> .
now , i like a little extreme be , you know , how little appetite for me on the <unk> of memories , but even if you more of doing it 's a real question . why are we are memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we <unk> be ?
so i hope you about an experiment to think .
so you put your next vacation ago , you know that the end of <unk> all their pictures <unk> , and they get a <unk> drug , so that it to do n't remember .
now , they would the same vacation vote ?
and if you a different vacation vote , there 's a conflict between your two types of self and you have about it , like this conflict choose and this is really not obvious , because if you in the time thinking they get an answer , and if you in the sense of memories think , you could have another answer .
why we <unk> pick that we choose is a problem that we do with a choice between the two types of themselves .
now , the two types of itself out two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we use , one in itself .
you can you ask : how happy about this <unk> itself ?
and then they would say , how are happy those moments in life of <unk> itself ?
and they 're all of happiness in moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that -- can be ?
and , incidentally , we 're now able to be a pretty good idea to get away from the lucky enough of <unk> ourselves over the time .
if you to be the <unk> to ask it 's a very different thing .
it 's not about how to be happy one person who lives .
so it away , as being right up the person is if this person about their lives it .
very different term .
anyone who 's those terms of different from the exploration of happiness up , and i belong to a lot of researchers about comfort , and exploration of happiness long <unk> have on this way .
the distinction between the lucky enough of <unk> themselves and the average happiness of <unk> itself is in recent years recognized , and now an effort you , the two <unk> to measure .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , the more than a half million people ask to have been about what you about their life thinking and about their experiences . and there was another efforts in the way .
in recent years , we have begun to fortunate to the two types of themselves .
and the <unk> lesson that we , i 've learned is you really different .
you know , as being someone with his life is , and that tells you really not a lot about how to be happy and his life lives and vice versa .
and you an idea of the correlation to be able to the correlation 's sort of <unk> .
what that means is that if you want one hit , and you would tell you , oh , his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about its size know ?
well , they would hear about its size know , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell them that somebody his life than eight at a scale of 10 <unk> , you have a lot of uncertainty about how , then he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we do something about what the average happiness of <unk> .
we know that money very important , goals are very important .
we know that , basically means , very pleased to be with people that we like that time to spend with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but this is dominant .
so fortunate to the two types of to maximize want you 're at the very different things .
the conclusion of the , what i said , is that we 're really not going to a <unk> for comfort .
it 's a completely another term .
now , very quickly , the other reason , from the we do n't know about happiness can think is that we 're not on the same things as if we think about the life thinking and if we actually live .
so , the simple question now , as happy to the people in california are you will not the correct answer .
if they ask you think that people in california happy to be if you , say , in ohio .
and what happens is that if you about the lives in california to think , think of the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , say , in the climate .
now , it turns out that climate not very important to the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important to the <unk> itself , and decide , as happy to people are .
well , because it <unk> yourself responsible , you end up -- some people might end up to california .
and it 's kind of interesting to track , what happens with people who have to california , in the hope to be happier .
now , you <unk> themselves will be happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're thinking that they are happier , because if you think they will of , how awful the weather in ohio , and they 're going to feel that they are the right made .
it 's very difficult to be clear about comfort thinking , and i hope , i did you an idea of that , how hard it 's .
thank you .
thank you have a question of them .
thank you .
now , when we have a few weeks <unk> 've mentioned , let me to that there 's a pretty interesting thing was that the <unk> survey .
it 's something that they 're going to participate in now , because they 're a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think that <unk> result , that we in the <unk> survey 've found is a number that we absolutely not to expect .
we found that in terms of fortunate to the <unk> itself .
when we look at the feelings of the income <unk> .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large <unk> of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a representative <unk> , under a income of 600,000 dollars a year .
around .
dk : around .
60,000 dollars a year are the people unhappy , and they become increasingly <unk> , the poorer they 're going .
and we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i 've ever so flat lines .
and what happens is obvious that money , no <unk> <unk> , but the lack of money , certainly misery <unk> , and we can make this misery very , you measure .
in the other self , the <unk> itself , you get another story .
the more money you of the <unk> is you .
it 's not for .
but danny , the american <unk> it 's about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
when people that finding more seriously consider , i mean , it 's all in the head to ask , everything that we think , for in terms of <unk> .
there 's a chance that politicians that the country in a finding the hypothetical seriously consider , and it on politics are going ?
dk : you know , i believe that it recognition is for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition is slow to be in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom is what you just and in other countries is what you .
so people are , <unk> that they 're going to be thinking , if you think about politics .
it 's a while take , and people will discuss that if you <unk> explore , or whether they <unk> explore , so we have this discussion pretty soon .
you how to increase can go very differently depending on them , as you think and if you think about this <unk> even think , or whether you think about this <unk> itself .
this is politics are , i think in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you look at that <unk> the population to measure .
this is , i think in the next one or two decades of the national statistic .
now , it seems to , this topic , or should be at the <unk> political debate going to track be about the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thanks , danny <unk> .
i 'm jane mcgonigal , i <unk> games .
i <unk> now for 10 years <unk> , and my goal for the next decade , it as easy to the world in reality to save , in <unk> to save .
i have a plan for it . i want more people to convince them , including you all , more time to play more and <unk> games to spend .
now , we three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` it 's a lot of time for games . ''
maybe a little too much time , when you think about how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve .
indeed , my research on the institute for the future that is the opposite <unk> .
three billion hours per week is not nearly enough to the <unk> problems of the world to solve .
and i 'm convinced that if we the next century on the planet survive , we have this time to dramatically increase .
i work out that took time , 21 billion hours <unk> per week .
it appears first maybe something <unk> , so repeating it , so there are ca : when we have problems of hunger , poverty , climate , global conflict and obesity to do , i think we have to try to play online for at 21 billion hours per week , the end of the next decade .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why do this is pretty well , why i believe that play is critical for the survival of human species in the future , seriously .
this is a <unk> of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings to play catch . so he 's going on the players have a camera up .
this is one of the classic expressions to play .
if you ca n't a player , <unk> you may be some of the <unk> in this picture .
so you probably this sense of urgency , a fear , but also <unk> concentration , <unk> in the problems of a really tough problem .
if you 're going to play , you see some <unk> here , after the top <unk> eyes and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the brow a surprise .
this is a player , the edge of a so-called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok <unk> . so we have a player .
a <unk> victory is a result , this very good is you before n't know that there 's not possible .
it was almost the imagination .
and if you do , they 're shocked that they actually to that are able to , that 's a <unk> victory .
this player 's about a <unk> victory .
and this is it , what we 're going to millions of their faces of <unk> the world 's why do , if we have the barriers , the next century to attack , the face those who in all against the edge of <unk> <unk> .
well , we see more like this face in real life , if we want problems to face .
i call it as the `` in life , i bad . <unk> , and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
this is me , as i the `` in life , i bad . <unk> do .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was in my ph.d. <unk> why we 're going to play it 's when the real life .
this is a problem that a player .
we think that we in reality not as well , how to play .
and i 'm not just a successful , though that .
we reach into <unk> more . i mean , in the context of the motivation , a little <unk> to do that inspired to work together .
if we 're in a <unk> are , i believe that many of us , in our best of turn , anytime and immediately <unk> , <unk> the problem to solve are actually , so long as is necessary , it for the <unk> back to try .
and in reality , if we are failing , if we have are going to feel we often very different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated , we feel threatened , and depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings , we 've never , if we 'll play , into play , there you just not .
and that 's what i as <unk> study .
why is it into play impossible to think , you could n't easy to do ?
how we can these feelings of the play in the reality to ?
so i 'm like the world of warcraft , that the ideal environment for going solving is .
and i have some things i realized that epic <unk> in <unk> as possible .
so , first , if you in one of <unk> get , especially in the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of characters that are ready , you a <unk> mission <unk> , and it immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that are perfectly to its current level of the game is , right ?
so let them that .
they never had a task that do n't you can solve .
but always the edge of their skills , so you have to have , but it 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you 're not around and turns <unk> , there 's always very <unk> something important to do .
and there 's <unk> staff .
where they also , hundreds of people with them together to their epic mission <unk> .
so we have in real life 's not easy , this sense that in a <unk> <unk> employees to stand .
moreover , there is this epic story , this inspiring story , why we go there are , and what we want to do .
then get so this whole positive feedback .
they have surely , `` level up '' and `` plus-one strength , one or `` plus-one intelligence .
this constant feedback , there 's not in the real life .
so this stage 'll leave , i do is plus-one talk and plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i am in real life that feedback .
so , the problem <unk> the world of warcraft is that it 's <unk> , at the edge of <unk> <unk> to stop that we prefer our whole time in these <unk> spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years with trying to the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
that 's not necessarily a bad .
it might <unk> .
but to it 's the context to see , in <unk> million years , our first <unk> maintain .
so the <unk> <unk> so .
ok , so if we talk about , how much time we are going to play , do it just a sense , when you look at the time in terms of the scale of human development in front of what 's extremely .
but also be appropriate , because it turns out that we , and this whole time to play use , in the climate change , what we as human being able to .
we 're us to collaborative <unk> , very nature .
this is the truth , because i believe .
if you look at this interesting , who have a researcher at the carnegie mellon university published was : the average young man of today in a country with strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . age .
so , 10,000 hours a very interesting number of two reasons .
well , for children in the united states are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> that you in school , from the five . great to the closing the high school -- if you never been missing .
so we have a complete <unk> , on the young people just learning , what it , a good players to be like anything else that you in school .
and may have some of them the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> , '' was reading .
so you know about his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great research on the <unk> that if we have 10,000 hours with the <unk> studying of any subject to the 21st century . of time , we 're going to <unk> in it .
we 're so well , which , to do as the of people the world .
so , what we have here is a total generation of young people that <unk> .
the big question is so , `` what exactly the players <unk> right ? ''
because if we find that , we would have sort of first ever since <unk> human potential to provide .
so many people , we currently in the world that look at least one hour a day with <unk> spend .
these are our <unk> , 500 million people who were extraordinarily well in `` something '' .
and the next decade , we 've got another one billion players that were extraordinarily well in which , are .
if you have n't heard ,
the <unk> developed <unk> , the energy save and on <unk> work , instead of <unk> , so that the world , especially in india , china , brazil online games .
you 're an extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so i started , to think , what it 's what we all these games to <unk> .
here are the four things that i found , the first thing : <unk> .
ok , think about that the extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is the desire , right thing to do a <unk> to <unk> , together to think that we have a <unk> hope for success .
so think , that a <unk> victory is possible , and that it 's worth , it to try and it 's right .
players are not around .
players are masters in <unk> 's social nets .
it 's a lot more studies that show that we are more like , after we with you played , even if they 're <unk> defeated .
the reason is that there 's a lot of trust requires , with somebody a game .
we trust that any time with us to spend that the rules <unk> going to the goal , and to the <unk> about to stay .
so it allows the <unk> that grow from <unk> , trust and each other .
as a result of that we build more social relations .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason that the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week is , sort of <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we are actually be happier , hard to work , as if we will or doing nothing .
we know that we as human beings can work , if we 're going to great do .
and players are always ready , hard to work , if you the task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love it , in awe <unk> missions <unk> <unk> .
here <unk> , and the right light to go back . you know , all of wikipedia , the <unk> the world .
the second <unk> the world , with them about 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft on the <unk> than about some other issue in each other <unk> the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so those are four superpowers to a single thing . players are <unk> , hopeful .
it 's people who believe that you a single change the world .
and the only problem is you believe , you can see the virtual worlds change , but not the real .
this is the problem that i want to solve try .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he looked at , why people as much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to witnesses told by not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> . ''
and that by an economist , so he 's logically .
and they say ...
not as i -- i <unk> games , i 'm going to <unk> .
so he says , that will actually make sense , because player can see in <unk> more , as in real life .
you can go into play more social <unk> do when the real life . they get more feedback and rewards in play as in real life .
so , he says , it 's currently perfect sense that players have more time in the virtual world as in the real time .
i agree first time to know , it 's logically .
but it 's definitely no <unk> .
we need to the real world in a game to turn .
my inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years <unk> .
there are these <unk> cube , from <unk> , you know ?
so these fantastic <unk> there <unk> .
and that were kind of the first of people were <unk> .
and if you with the <unk> of the ancient greek <unk> <unk> 're familiar , you know about maybe this story . the story about how , and why games invented .
according <unk> were playing games , specifically <unk> , in the kingdom <unk> during a famine invented .
supposedly , there was one such great famine that the king of <unk> look at a crazy idea decided .
the people <unk> , the people were .
it was an extreme situation , you took an extreme solution .
so they invented , according <unk> that <unk> and <unk> a national strategy , in one day would you eat . the next day you would play .
and they were so much in the <unk> <unk> be , there 'll be so fascinating , and to <unk> , <unk> productivity by that you remember , that there 's nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you would play , and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> survived and so 18 years for those famine , by them in one day eating and the next played .
likewise , i think , we 'll play a .
we 're playing a to the suffering from the real world to that .
we 're playing a to do anything to <unk> that in the real world does n't work , everything that in real life does n't <unk> , and we bring us what we need from the play .
but this must not the end .
that 's exciting .
according <unk> was looking for 18 years of famine not better . i decided to the king , one last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two <unk> .
they were a <unk> and the winner got to a <unk> adventure <unk> .
they were <unk> and made on the search for a new home . they were just as many people back , like this food to survive , and went to the rest of an area , they would flourish .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but like <unk> show that the <unk> that later that <unk> 're trained , the same dna as the old <unk> have .
so , scientists have to the notion that <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and geologists found evidence is a global <unk> that almost 20 years was what the famine explain .
so , these crazy story voices .
you might have in their people through play rescued , you 18 years for in games <unk> , and then this <unk> , and so much about this to play learned that they 're doing the whole civilization saved .
so , that we can also .
we 're playing in 1994 warcraft .
it was the first <unk> in the world of <unk> . that was 16 years .
they were 18 years for <unk> , we 're playing around for 16 years of warcraft .
i would argue , we 're ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent a half of civilization in the search for a new world . so i mean 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should look at <unk> that half of us an hour a day with them spend , until we the problems of the real world solved .
i know , they 're wondering , `` how do we are the real world into play ? '' and this question i put my work in recent years on the institute for the future dedicated .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it <unk> out how we 're going to understand .
we do n't want to the future , before to say .
what we want , is the future .
we want to the best possible outcomes . and then people to <unk> , this idea in the reality to .
we put us epic <unk> , and give people who are ways that you .
i 'll show you very quickly , games that i designed to have to try to people epic <unk> in their own future of it .
this is the world without oil . ''
this game is by 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , where you a <unk> overcome .

we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 tested . and we do you have been talking about the last three years with .
and i can tell you , it was a changing .
nobody wants to his life change , because it 's good for the environment , or because we should .
but if it in a <unk> adventures are , and told them , `` look at the oil . ''
this is an amazing adventure , that you go .
you find out , as you survive . the most of the players have the game <unk> habits <unk> .
so we for the next <unk> play a bigger , higher goal into the only <unk> .
we have the game called `` <unk> '' the institute for the future .
where is the calculation of <unk> that the people just have 23 years on the left .
this supercomputer 's called global <unk> <unk> , '' of course .
the call the players , <unk> , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> designed .
you know jerry <unk> , where it 's the <unk> '' there . you have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> and all together , they can see the world .
but in your game , instead of only five people , say , everyone is in the <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 players have played the game five weeks for .
they found the incredibly creative solutions that you read , if you `` <unk> '' <unk> .
and the last game , we look at 3 . march out . it 's a game in collaboration with the world .
if you see the game to conclude , get them from the world the distinction , social <unk> , '' from 2010 .
we 're working with universities , in sub-saharan africa and , they have a lot of social <unk> .
we have a comic to . we have `` level up '' for <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want you 'd like , this game with the young people to share , all over the world , especially in <unk> , that benefit to put their own social <unk> that the world to save .
i 'm going to the end .
i want you some questions .
what happens to do you going on the next ?
we all these fantastic players , we 'll play , the show us , what we can do , but we have the real world 's not be saved .
well , i hope you to do agree that that human resources are that we have to work in real life to use , and that play a big meaning for change .
we have this all superpowers to <unk> productivity , the ability to close the nets to do , <unk> and this desire for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we have a great playing games to the one last century to survive .
and i hope you 're going to me like to design and play .
if i want to the next decade <unk> , i am i look at two things that , that we have any <unk> to create , and that we all kinds of play games .
so i say , let the <unk> 'll start .
thanks .
i would you 'd like a little bit about what to me a few months to write an article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i have to write and my <unk> <unk> , but i was with the process of <unk> already done , and i noticed that i have never been in my life <unk> , what the word `` disabled , really means .
i read them the post .

<unk> , healthy , strong , <unk> . ''
i have this list of a friend , according <unk> and had first laugh , it <unk> 's ridiculous , but i was just to `` <unk> '' and could n't even more <unk> , and had to stop to read and i first , after this <unk> <unk> and so <unk> emotional shock .
it was that a <unk> , old <unk> . i 'm just thought that 's edition , very old to be .
but actually , it was a copy of the early '80s , when i just looked at the elementary started and started , my <unk> outside of my <unk> <unk> build and to form , even in terms of other children and at the world to move around me .
and god , you have i did n't <unk> used .
i 'd like this post seriously consider that i in a world was born , somebody like me as a person to see , whose lives in <unk> a positive that . today , but i 'm going to the opportunity and adventure , i experienced , celebrated .
so i immediately the <unk> of 2009 navigated and expect that i 'm a <unk> contribution think .
there 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
<unk> it 's not much better .
and <unk> me the last two words , `` <unk> <unk> '' `` well , '' and `` healthy .
but it 's not just the words .
it 's about what we think about the people think that we with these words .
it 's about the values that in those words stuck , and how we have these values build .
our language that affect our thinking and how we the world and the people around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greek and the <unk> , really believed that the <unk> one <unk> a great force , because it , what you want to <unk> , also <unk> .
so , what we want to actually <unk> -- a <unk> people or a <unk> people ?
just been a people <unk> as a to call that could <unk> , they <unk> and you ideas <unk> .
it would not beautiful , you the doors to open up ?
a person who had to me the doors has opened , was my pediatrician in <unk> . <unk> institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he is dr. <unk> , a <unk> , whose name , as you think , the most americans are not accurate just could . so he was always dr. p. called .
and dr. p. was always very colorful fly and was for the work with kids just like created .
i found the time that i do in the hospital spent , just great -- to my <unk> .
i had to be exercises , infinitely often do with these <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know , to my <unk> build up , and i got these <unk> more hated than anything else . i think they hated , i <unk> . i think they hated it .
and so , , i even have known as <unk> child with dr. p. negotiate and trying to exercises to stop , <unk> without success .
and one day he has to one of exercises in -- these exercises were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , `` wow <unk> , you 're like a strong , <unk> and young girl , you 're going to one day one of <unk> <unk> .
and if you <unk> , i want to a hundred dollars . ''
this was of course , just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i the exercises do that i do n't make wanted , with the prospect that the richest <unk> girl in the <unk> the second cane , but he was actually to , my daily <unk> with new eyes . it was from a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder , today , as well and his vision of myself as strong and <unk> young girl my <unk> shaped , and i 'm like that was able to me as a lot of nature of a strong , <unk> and <unk> person .
this is just an example of many , as adults , <unk> the imagination a child <unk> .
but how are already <unk> examples from the <unk> prove that makes us our language is no room , something that what we all want , it every single time to enable us to yourself as <unk> people .
our language <unk> the social changes as that in many of a technological change triggered by .
the medical standpoint , if you can of saying that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titan , artificial <unk> for <unk> body , it people to really all your choices to use and over the boundaries of them their natural fate of the , out to develop , not to talk about social <unk> platforms that people make a own identity , to own way , and the way that , and so the world to groups with that you to pick .
maybe that so this technological change <unk> because the that there 's always been a different fact , which is that every person of society something very <unk> and very <unk> can be and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt -- that 's an interesting story , because people , again and being asked to tell , as i with against <unk> and i 'm going to confess , this sentence , i never <unk> and i was always very uncomfortable with it felt that question of people to answer , and i believe , gradually i , why .
this sentence , with against lives of the idea that success or happiness of it depends on , a challenge to <unk> , of them together experience by , as if my life so successful that would , because i was the kinds fall of life with a prosthetic of , or like , people to me with my disability perceive .
but the truth is that we change course we 've gone from the challenge by , whether you physically , emotionally or even both .
and i would argue that this is good .
against are not an obstacle that we <unk> have to deal with our lives better clear .
against 're going to our lives .
and i tend to against as my shadow .
sometimes <unk> i that he 's very your mind is , sometimes it 's not to see , but it 's always trying to me .
and i want to do n't the effect , and the heavy of <unk> of people <unk> .
there are in life against the challenges , and they are just <unk> real and every person 's going to it differently about , but the question is not , whether we do with against clear , or not , but how we would make sure .
so we 're not just this together , the people we love , <unk> to maintain , but they also to prepare a good to make sure .
and to prove our kids do n't know , if we give you feel that give you to n't have to adapt .
you have two things to separate , for one of the fact , an amputee , and the other the social think about , if i disabled , or not .
and to be honest , the only real and <unk> disability , with the i just put this is that the world and says , they could make me with these definitions .
in our desire , the people to protect the us to care about and you the cold , the truth about their medical a prediction <unk> or even a a prediction for quality to imagine that you expect , we have to take care that we do n't want to become to put that somebody who actually disabled .
maybe it 's <unk> concept , the only on <unk> , what in a broken , and how we fix , for every single a greater disability than the pathology , .
if we have a people do n't <unk> treat , and not all the forces and possibilities of course , acknowledge , let 's in addition to the natural struggle that you might lead to another disease .
we <unk> a people who had to our society a value .
so we have about the <unk> out and look at all the area of human possibilities .
the most important but is that it between the perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> , a connection .
we should those <unk> times n't <unk> or <unk> , we should n't try to them to avoid , we should you among the carpet return , but it 's about the against opportunity to see .
i 'm perhaps more about , right to imagine that we against are not get to , but we 're going to open , you to hug , you look at <unk> to put it also a <unk> to use and maybe even to dance .
and maybe do we make it , against as a natural , <unk> and useful to see and feel that through their presence of no more like <unk> .
this year of the 200 years that 's birthday , charles darwin and when he was 150 years of evolution has written in fact , darwin , in my view , on something very true in the human nature <unk> .
i 'd like <unk> , not the most of survive , and also not the <unk> of , but the , that changes the adapt .
of conflicts of creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the ability of people , to survive and <unk> , from the battle of human mind , is to act of conflicts of them into .
so , again , change and adapt are the of skills of people .
and maybe we know it , from the timber we <unk> , if we really <unk> .
perhaps is that the sense of against , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can go so even something to give them .
we can turn against a new meaning , the of heavy time out .
maybe we against a change .
against stand for a change , that we have n't adapted .
i think that the damage that we ourselves <unk> have is to believe that we 're normal to be .
to be honest , who is normal ?
there 's not normal .
there 's the usual , the typical place , but not the normal , and they would those poor , gray person 's really aware of learning , and if you would be ?
i think , not .
it would be great , if we have this paradigm of normality against one of ways , or the strength , and even a bit dangerous to <unk> , exchange , so we can the forces of a lot to release , and that to invite , their very special and valuable skills in the society myself .
<unk> 've just found that we humans from the members of our society , one <unk> have , useful , and a major contribution to afford .
there is evidence that 's the <unk> about 60,000 years older people and people with severe physical injuries , worn , and that happened , perhaps because the <unk> in <unk> of the society it was ,
they have these people do n't being broken and useless at ; they were as something special and <unk> treated .
a few years ago , i went in the city , i grew up , in a <unk> in the `` red zone , in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there before a <unk> tomatoes .
it was the summer and i had <unk> .
and i hear , as a guy behind me , `` well if that does n't <unk> <unk> is . ''
and i turn , and see the older man . i had no idea who he 's .
and i said `` sorry , sir , that we do and i ca n't want to remember . ''
and he said , `` well , they <unk> to do n't wait to me .
when i want you for the first saw , i put them from the belly of her mother <unk> . ''
oh , so the .
and of it , but click .
this is dr. <unk> , a man that i just like narratives of my mother about this day know , because i course , very typical place , to my birthday two weeks , too late .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mother was on vacation , and so knew my parents the man who me to the world 's got to do n't .
and because i do without <unk> was born , and my feet to them a , and i just a few toes that and a few toes the other foot , he was the <unk> , that strangers to the bad news <unk> .
he told me , `` i had to your parents say that you never going would , and never been so <unk> be going to the other children or you were never a <unk> life , could , and since they 've got me just lying <unk> . ''
really exceptional , i found that he <unk> my entire childhood collected , anyway , if i look at a <unk> in the second grade won , if i with the <unk> the <unk> to <unk> on , anyway , if i scholarship or one of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he used these clips to his students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x factor , the potential of human willing .
you can just not enough to the critical of a factor for the quality of people can be .
and dr. <unk> said , he said , `` i learned that kids , if you do n't always trying to say , and even if you just a little support , if you have to <unk> , then there 's very much . ''
you see , dr. <unk> has to be thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and as someone with <unk> , two different things .
and i i think the time has changed , if you me at age of 15 years asked , if i mean prostheses to legs of meat and bone <unk> , then i would have a second <unk> .
i wanted was necessarily a normal work .
if you see me that today , i 'm not so sure .
and that 's happening , because i was something with my legs experienced , and not in spite of these experiences .
and maybe you could this change also happen , because i was so many people <unk> 'm trying to me the open , instead of people to face to me <unk> or me an idea <unk> wanted .
you see , it really just a people who you demos , the forces <unk> can , and they 're going through .
if you to enable , his own , inside forces to activate the -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you create , and for someone in a critical moment of an open up , they 're for these people a very good teachers .
they bring them , to the doors to open .
the importance of the word `` <unk> '' <unk> in the word `` <unk> .
it means something on that in fact , the potential <unk> .
again , which potential to let 's because now <unk> ?
in the years ago was in britain 's a <unk> done . there were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` <unk> <unk> '' in the u.s. is that as `` <unk> .
the students are going to music into .
and a student , <unk> harder <unk> to get the better teacher etc .
they then about a <unk> period students , `` enough , the note , very well , given . it was going to say , they were <unk> that you very smart . and after these three months , they really <unk> written .
and of <unk> it 's the heart to hear that the the <unk> said , they were just enough .
and as it was then after the three months .
but only ones that are still in school were -- from the students that the school <unk> .
so essential for this study was that the teachers wo n't <unk> .
the teachers did n't know that something changed .
they were just told that are the <unk> and that are the students with the note enough , and as you have you something to and they 're treated .
the only real disability is a <unk> mind is a spirit , the broken , has no hope . he 's nothing more beautiful . it is our natural , <unk> curiosity . and our innate capacity of imagination .
if we actually create , the human spirit , to support to continue to hope to yourself and other people to look around you to find that curious , and <unk> , then put we are forces really positive .
if a spirit of those qualities has , we can a new reality and new <unk> .
i want to a poem end , that by persian poet named <unk> in 14 . century wrote , and of my friend jacques <unk> told , and the poem called `` the god , the only four words . '' `` every child knows , not the god the name , not the god the <unk> , but the god , the only four words know , and these are repeated , he says , only : come to dance with me . ''
come to dance with me . thanks .
